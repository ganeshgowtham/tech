Here are detailed Cluster Tests for an application deployed in an Active-Active OpenShift cluster environment:

1. Cluster Health and Node Status Tests

Objective: Ensure all nodes in the cluster are healthy and operational.

Test Cases:
	•	Node Readiness Test:
	•	Steps: Run oc get nodes and verify all nodes are in Ready state.
	•	Expected Outcome: All nodes show Ready status.

	•	Expected Outcome: Sufficient disk space is available for logs, pods, and operations (typically 70% or less used).

2. Pod Deployment and Scheduling Tests

Objective: Verify that pods are deployed and scheduled correctly across the cluster.

Test Cases:
	•	Pod Distribution Test:
	•	Steps: Deploy your application and run oc get pods -o wide to check pod distribution across nodes.
	•	Expected Outcome: Pods are evenly distributed across nodes (depends on configured affinity/anti-affinity rules).
	•	Pod Rescheduling Test:
	•	Steps: Simulate a node failure (e.g., cordon a node using oc adm cordon <node> and delete a pod).
	•	Expected Outcome: Pods are rescheduled to other available nodes without downtime.

3. Cluster Scaling Tests

Objective: Test the cluster’s ability to scale up or down to meet workload demands.

Test Cases:
	•	Manual Node Scaling Test:

	•	Horizontal Pod Auto-Scaling (HPA) Test:
	•	Steps: Configure HPA for an application (oc autoscale deployment <app> --cpu-percent=50 --min=2 --max=10). Generate load to trigger scaling.
	•	Expected Outcome: Application scales out/in as per the defined thresholds.

6. Security and Configuration Management Tests

Objective: Validate cluster security and configurations.

Test Cases:
	•	RBAC Validation Test:
	•	Steps: Assign roles and test access to resources with different user accounts.

	•	Expected Outcome: Secrets are accessible only to authorized pods.
	•	OpenShift Security Context Constraints (SCC) Test:
	•	Steps: Ensure pods adhere to the SCC assigned (e.g., restricted, anyuid).
	•	Expected Outcome: Pods cannot violate the constraints assigned.

7. Observability and Monitoring Tests

Objective: Ensure proper observability of cluster metrics and logs.

Test Cases:
	•	Prometheus Metrics Test:
	•	Steps: Check Prometheus dashboards for node and pod metrics (CPU, memory, network).
	•	Expected Outcome: Metrics are accurate and up-to-date.
	•	Log Aggregation Test:
	•	Steps: Use OpenShift Logging (e.g., EFK stack) to verify log aggregation from all pods and nodes.
	•	Expected Outcome: Logs are collected and searchable.
	•	Alerting Test:
	•	Steps: Simulate conditions that trigger alerts (e.g., high CPU load) and verify alert delivery.
	•	Expected Outcome: Alerts are received as configured (e.g., email, Slack).

8. Upgrade and Backup Tests

Objective: Validate the cluster’s ability to handle upgrades and data recovery.

Test Cases:
	•	Cluster Upgrade Test:
	•	Steps: Perform a rolling upgrade of the OpenShift cluster.
	•	Expected Outcome: No downtime; workloads remain operational during the upgrade.
	•	Etcd Backup and Restore Test:
	•	Steps: Take a backup of the etcd database and restore it to a new cluster.
	•	Expected Outcome: Restored cluster contains the same data as the original.

Here’s a detailed breakdown of tests to perform in Stability, Load, Reliability, Performance, and Availability categories for an application deployed in an Active-Active OpenShift environment:

1. Stability Tests

Objective: Validate that the system performs consistently under expected conditions over an extended period.

Test Cases:
	•	Long-Running Test:
	•	Steps: Simulate steady traffic to the application for an extended period (e.g., 24–72 hours).
	•	Expected Outcome: No crashes, memory leaks, or degradation in performance.

	•	Steps: Change environment variables, ConfigMaps, or Secrets dynamically while the application is running.
	•	Expected Outcome: Application handles configuration changes without restarting unnecessarily.
	•	Resource Stress Test:
	•	Steps: Gradually reduce available cluster resources (e.g., limit memory or CPU on nodes) and observe application behavior.
	•	Expected Outcome: Application remains stable, scaling as needed, or providing graceful degradation.

2. Load Tests

Objective: Ensure the application and cluster can handle expected and peak loads efficiently.
