# Intern Capstone Project Overview

## Abstract
This capstone project focuses on developing a user-friendly money transfer application that simulates the interaction between creditor and debtor accounts. Utilizing ReactJS for the front-end interface and Spring Boot for the back-end services, the application connects to a MongoDB database to securely manage user accounts and transactions. The project aims to provide a seamless experience for users to initiate, track, and manage money transfers while ensuring data integrity and security. The application serves as a practical demonstration of modern web development techniques and principles, highlighting the integration of various technologies.

## Project Description
The money transfer application is designed to facilitate the simulation of financial transactions between two parties: a creditor and a debtor. The project encompasses the following key components:

- **Front-End Development**: Built with ReactJS, the user interface is intuitive and responsive, allowing users to easily navigate through account management and transaction processes. Key features include:
  - User authentication and account creation
  - Dashboard for viewing account balances and transaction history
  - Forms for initiating money transfers and viewing transfer status

- **Back-End Development**: The server-side application is developed using Spring Boot, which provides a robust framework for building RESTful APIs. It handles:
  - User authentication and authorization
  - Business logic for processing transactions
  - Integration with MongoDB for data storage and retrieval

- **Database Management**: MongoDB is utilized to store user account information, transaction records, and other relevant data. The NoSQL database allows for flexible data modeling and efficient querying.

The project will be developed in phases, with a focus on agile methodologies to ensure adaptability and continuous improvement based on user feedback.

## Milestones
1. **Project Initialization** (Week 1-2)
   - Define project scope and requirements
   - Set up development environment and repository
   - Create initial project structure for front-end and back-end

2. **Front-End Development** (Week 3-5)
   - Design wireframes and UI mockups
   - Implement user authentication and account management features
   - Develop transaction initiation and tracking interfaces

3. **Back-End Development** (Week 6-8)
   - Set up Spring Boot application and RESTful endpoints
   - Implement user authentication and authorization mechanisms
   - Develop business logic for processing money transfers

4. **Database Integration** (Week 9)
   - Design MongoDB schema for user accounts and transactions
   - Implement data access layer to interact with the database

5. **Testing and Quality Assurance** (Week 10-11)
   - Conduct unit and integration testing for both front-end and back-end
   - Perform user acceptance testing to gather feedback

6. **Deployment and Documentation** (Week 12)
   - Deploy the application to a cloud platform (e.g., Heroku, AWS)
   - Create user documentation and technical reports

## Measures of Success
- **Functionality**: The application must successfully allow users to create accounts, initiate money transfers, and view transaction history without errors.
- **User Experience**: Achieve a positive user feedback score of at least 85% based on usability tests and surveys conducted during user acceptance testing.
- **Performance**: Ensure that the application can handle at least 100 concurrent users without performance degradation, measured through load testing.
- **Code Quality**: Maintain a code quality score of 80% or higher, as assessed by static code analysis tools (e.g., SonarQube).
- **Documentation**: Complete and comprehensive documentation should be provided, including user guides and technical specifications, ensuring that future developers can easily understand and maintain the application.

By meeting these milestones and success criteria, the project will not only demonstrate technical proficiency but also provide a valuable learning experience in full-stack development.
