Monitor pod rescheduling and application recovery.                                                                 | Pods should be rescheduled to healthy nodes, and the application should recover without downtime or data loss.                                                  | High         | High         |
| TC09             | **Persistent Storage Stress Test**: Simulate heavy I/O operations.  | 1. Perform continuous read/write operations on persistent storage. <br> 2. Monitor storage performance and application behavior.                                              | Persistent storage should handle heavy I/O without significant latency. The application should remain stable and functional during the test.                     | High         | Medium       |
| TC10             | **Cluster Upgrade Load Test**: Validate application stability during cluster upgrades. | 1. Perform a rolling update of the OpenShift cluster. <br> 2. Monitor application behavior and pod availability during the upgrade.                                           | The application should remain available and functional during the cluster upgrade. Pod disruptions should not exceed the thresholds defined in the PodDisruptionBudget (PDB). | Medium       | Medium       |

## Notes:
- **Tools to Use**: JMeter, Locust, K6, stress-ng, Chaos Mesh, Prometheus, and Grafana.  
- **Metrics to Monitor**:  
  - Response time (latency).  
  - Throughput (requests/sec).  
  - Resource utilization (CPU, memory, disk I/O).  
  - Error rate (% of failed requests).  
  - Auto-scaling events (number of pods).  
- **Integration**: Include these tests in CI/CD pipelines to ensure stability before production deployments.  

### Conclusion
Stress and performance testing validate the application's ability to handle high loads, recover from failures, and scale dynamically, ensuring stability and reliability in OpenShift.
