We’re creating smarter ways for U.S.-based companies and their subsidiaries to manage their global business. With Wells Fargo helping with your international treasury strategy, you’ll have the advantage of one banking relationship that offers both U.S. and in-region implementation and technical support. We can help you strengthen your relationships with your overseas employees, customers, and vendors because you’ll transact with them in currencies that best meet your needs and theirs. Our electronic payment and reporting services are available using one online platform with robust security, our Commercial Electronic Office® (CEO®) portal. You can also use CEO Mobile®, as available in a geographic region, to monitor your accounts, approve transactions, and receive reporting on the go. We offer: Simplified cash management  Manage your Wells Fargo accounts online — CEO connects your offices, operations, and subsidiaries so you can work conveniently and efficiently. Potentially accelerate your cash flow from foreign receivables — make and collect payments in region. Increase visibility into your global cash position — on one single sign-on platform you’ll have end of day and intraday reporting in the same formats for all your Wells Fargo accounts and accounts you hold with other banks.  Easier transactions  Transact throughout the world in multiple currencies — you’ll settle to accounts in those currencies. Where you have receivables that match your required payables currencies, pay your trading partners and others without converting one currency to another — you’ll potentially reduce your foreign exchange cost.  For more resources and insights, read Business Viewpoints.


Our global accounts can help you manage your international operating flows in ways very similar to your day-to-day U.S. treasury activities. You can keep your familiar Wells Fargo banking relationships, customer service, and online access, so that you achieve the simplicity you want. U.S. Foreign Currency Accounts If you’re concerned about foreign exchange risk or the additional due diligence of overseas bank accounts, then a Wells Fargo U.S. Foreign Currency Account may be your best solution. We offer 28 currencies. Because you transact in the account’s currency, you can make outbound wire payments and deposit wire receivables without foreign exchange transaction costs. Because you hold these accounts in the U.S., you no longer need to prepare Foreign Bank Account Reporting (FBAR). Moreover, these accounts are eligible for Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) insurance. How it works  You open an account using a process similar to opening a U.S. demand deposit account. You send wire payments securely cross border from the U.S. using the same channel you use for your U.S. dollar (USD) accounts: CEO® Wires, Foreign Exchange on CEO®, Payment Manager®, or SWIFT services. You receive incoming wire transfers from around the world and incoming book transfers from your other U.S. Wells Fargo accounts. You optionally manage your cash — and cover overdrafts — by establishing a zero or target balance structure so that cash balances move automatically to a parent account.  Accounts for Canada Our in-country international bank accounts in USD and Canadian dollar give you the ability to send and receive electronic payments within Canada and cross border.,  They’re the basis of our Canadian treasury management solutions. Accounts for the U.K., Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA) With choices for British pound (GBP), Euro (EUR), and USD as well as 17 other currencies, a U.K. branch account lets you make non-urgent (Bacs), GBP Faster Payments, and urgent high-value GBP payables and receivables. In addition, approximately 600 partner bank branches throughout the U.K. provide over-the-counter services. You can also initiate and receive same day EUR payments throughout Europe. For non-urgent payments, you can take advantage of the simplified payment format for Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) for both payables and receivables. These accounts are the basis of our EMEA treasury management solutions.


With cross-border and in-country options, you can flexibly make and collect international payments.  Global ACH — With a U.S. USD account, you can send repetitive, non-urgent batch payments (ACH credits) in nine currencies using our Global ACH service. With a U.K. branch account, you can use the same online service to send ACH credits in 11 currencies, so that you can reach more than 40 countries and territories. Beneficiaries receive electronic payments typically within two to five business days. Wire transfers — You can send and receive wires conveniently using the initiation option that suits your needs: online, consolidated payables, SWIFT, or (in the U.S.) application programming interface (API). Payment Manager® — You can streamline your global payments process by sending one file with multiple payment types and related remittance information. This consolidated payables service lets you send files from your internal system. We separate the payments by type and then process them accordingly. By reducing the use of paper documents and manual data entry, you can potentially minimize mistakes and increase efficiency. Foreign Exchange on CEO® — You can send foreign exchange wires 24 hours a day, six days a week online that settle to your commercial accounts. You’ll benefit from live market rates for more than 120 currencies. If you need to generate an audit trail, you can debit a foreign draft with your Wells Fargo USD account and then print it from your location. SWIFT — You can streamline your back office by routing all payments and other transactions to Wells Fargo through SWIFT, a reliable connectivity channel. With request for transfer functionality, you can move money out of non-Wells Fargo accounts, giving you the benefit of concentrating funds.  The following two services help U.S.-based companies receive payments from individuals and entities located outside of the U.S. Global Invoice Connect® Our Global Invoice Connect with TransferMate® service — an inbound payments solution for you — can give your customers in more than 60 countries and territories a convenient electronic payment option in more than 35 currencies. Our service provider provides electronic bill presentment in USD or in your customers’ local currencies and then collects your funds direct to your U.S. USD account. You always receive your full invoiced amount, no matter how your customers pay. Global Check Clearing Through our direct relationships with foreign correspondent banks, combined with high-volume processing, we’re able to offer a cost-effective way to clear checks in a variety of foreign currencies or drawn on foreign banks in eligible countries. Depending on your current method of handling foreign check payments, your funds availability timing may improve.


Our reporting services on CEO® help you can gain insight and control over your global cash picture. Through this secure single sign-on portal, you view details of your pending and posted transactions from a browser on your desktop or mobile device. Additionally, CEO Mobile®, available in select geographic regions, gives you access to reporting on the go. You can alternatively obtain treasury reports by API, Direct BAI, SWIFT, and ISO 20022 channels.

IBAN stands for International Bank Account Number. It identifies an individual account, at a specific financial institution, in a particular country and is used to process financial transactions between institutions in different countries. Used correctly, the IBAN facilitates faster payment processing. Refer to the IBAN registry (PDF) for a list of countries that require IBANs and each country’s unique IBAN format. SWIFT (Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication) is the official IBAN registrar.



IBAN Format


Using IBAN


SWIFT BIC




The IBAN model creates a standard for account numbering among multiple countries. The model requires certain components to be present in all IBANs, but also allows for some flexibility for country-specific requirements. By adding components to existing account numbers, the IBAN improves a bank’s ability to process cross-border payments without having to manually repair transactions or replace existing account numbers. If you do not use the IBAN in countries that require its use, your payments might be returned without processing. An IBAN consists of up to 34 alphanumeric characters, which include the following:   Country code  – the ISO (International Organization for Standardization) country code   Check digits  – two check digits provided by the issuing financial institution based on a calculation that takes into account the entire IBAN   Bank identifier  – code that identifies the financial institution and, when appropriate, the branch of that financial institution servicing an account   Basic bank account number (BBAN)  – code that identifies an individual account, at a specific financial institution, in a particular country   Sample IBAN Format         Country Code Check Digits Bank Identifier Basic Bank Account Number (BBAN)     GB 76 PNBP 165671 12345678    Refer to the IBAN registry (PDF) for a list of countries that require IBANs and each country’s unique IBAN format.


When preparing your transaction:  Insert the IBAN in the account number field on any forms or screens used to create the payment Do not use both the account number and the IBAN. Remitters sometimes mistakenly insert the account number in the account number field and the IBAN in the bank-to-bank reference field or the OBI (Originating Beneficiary Information) field. Doing so will cause the payment to stop for repair at the beneficiary bank, negating the purpose of the IBAN. Instead, simply place the IBAN, which includes the account number, in the account number field. Include both the beneficiary’s IBAN and SWIFT BIC when making international payments destined for countries that participate in the IBAN registry (see “SWIFT BIC” tab). 


SWIFT BICs (business identifier codes), which are often called SWIFT codes, are a series of either eight or 11 alphanumeric characters that help to identify a specific financial institution. The number includes a bank code, a country code, a location code, and an optional branch code. Sample BIC         Bank Code Country Code Location Code Branch Code     PNBP GB 2L XXX (Represents the head office location)    Including an IBAN and a SWIFT BIC in wire instructions potentially will keep your wire fees lower because financial institutions in the beneficiary’s country may choose to either charge an additional fee for, or return, wires that do not include these numbers. Refer to our international resources for more information on SWIFT BIC numbers and other payment directories. Learn more about SWIFT.

Despite frequent fraud attempts, many businesses do not suffer financial losses because they implement strong fraud protection strategies. Is your organization protected?

Check fraud
Checks continue to be the payment method most often exposed to fraudulent activity. If your company writes checks or maintains checking accounts, we recommend you review the following services to ensure all your checking accounts have the fraud prevention and detection services for your company:  Positive Pay systematically compares checks presented for payment to your issued-check files to detect serial numbers and dollar amounts that don’t match. Payee validation identifies payee names that do not match the payee name information sent on your check issue files. Reverse Positive Pay is an alternative to positive pay services for companies unable to transmit issued-check files to Wells Fargo. You get the opportunity to review checks presented for payment and determine if they should be paid or returned. Payment Authorization enables you to place controls on your accounts that help to prevent fraudulent activity, specifically unauthorized checks and over the counter debits. 


ACH fraud
If you make ACH payments, these services can help protect you:   Wells Fargo ACH Fraud Filter – The "Stop" service automatically stops all ACH debits – except those you specifically pre-authorize – from posting to your accounts. The "Review" service presents transactions to you for pay or return decisions.     Perfect Receivables® service – If your company has a high volume of electronic receivables, reduce the risk that your account number will fall into the wrong hands. The  Perfect Receivables  service protects your account by providing "proxy" account numbers for your customers to use when remitting ACH and wire payments to you.  





Report Fraud
Act fast and follow these important steps immediately if you think you or your company might be the victim of a fraud or attempted fraud.

 For CFOs and treasury professionals, sleepless nights are nothing new, especially when it comes to cyber risk management. Sophisticated new threats emerge constantly, each with the potential to disrupt company payments, communications, or operations. Ransomware, denial of service attacks, and business email compromise are just a few of the popular tactics in use today. Establishing a mature cyber security program helps provide robust protection from these and other issues so finance can fulfill its mission. While the information or cyber security teams typically spearhead such an initiative, treasury management can play a critical role.  The strongest cyber security programs align with overall business strategy, creating a unified approach for assessing risk across the business. For treasury, it starts with open dialog to understanding how finance systems, processes, and payments fit into your company’s overall cyber defenses.  Strive for top-down support and cross-functional participation As you dive into cybersecurity, you may hear the phrase “cyber everywhere,” which refers to the ubiquitous nature of cyber threats in today’s complex and digitally connected world. An effective and mature cyber program should encompass a layered security environment of people, processes, and technology. This approach will aggressively and continually mitigate risk and enable you to build capabilities for future protection. Mature cyber security programs focus on security, vigilance, and resilience:  Security — Implementing policies, procedures, and cyber strategies to prevent and detect threats.  Vigilance — Rapidly detecting threats and attacks.  Resilience — Responding and recovering from attacks to restore business operations.  Visible, top-down support is another hallmark. Active involvement by senior leaders emphasizes the importance of cyber security to employees at levels and across all lines of business. Evolve your cyber maturity in these three areas Developing a mature cyber security program means taking a systematic and proactive approach to counteract potential threats. Here are three areas where treasury management can support your company’s efforts and help move your program forward.   Identify and detect threats   When you know the issues most likely to impact your business, it becomes easier to deploy the right protections. A mature cyber security program continually assesses risk factors, then develops processes to monitor and detect potential issues. With today’s interconnected landscape, your lens needs to look beyond internal systems, processes, and people; risk assessments and protections also need to flow through your vendors and supply chain.   Treasury can support your company efforts by sharing knowledge from your bank and payment providers and making sure finance staff understand their role in maintaining a secure environment. Assess organizational readiness   Once you’ve identified potential risks, your company can start to transform systems and processes to better defend your organization. Cross-functional planning sessions and tabletop exercises are two ways to assess your readiness, find gaps, and document resources. Treasury management should be a key participant when exploring any payment-related scenarios.  Respond and recover quickly   The final step toward cyber maturity establishes business continuity plans that indicate how you’ll manage daily operations if a cyber issue does occur. These may include setting up parallel system or processes, identifying critical communications, or testing alternative options with banks, vendors, and other providers. Advance preparation will help you respond and recover quickly.  Continually monitor and improve Just as cyber threats continually evolve, so should your company’s cyber security program. Achieving “maturity” is a continual journey without a clear finish line. However, the more your organization works together to assess and improve, the more resilience your company develops to keep pace with current and future risk factors.



Wedded to spreadsheets and manual data entry? Enjoying the grind of month-end close on day seven? Thrilled at the latest forecast that’s outdated by the time it’s built?  Few treasury professionals would say “yes” to these scenarios. It’s why automation projects are proliferating across finance. There are faster, better ways to work. However, getting corporate stakeholders to invest in treasury projects can be a tough sell. After all, the traditional view holds that accounts payable and receivable are cost centers, not profit-makers.  APIs are game-changers for treasury automation That perception is changing, especially as more businesses realize the competitive advantages that speed, accuracy, and automation can bring. It makes getting your treasury automation project on the corporate To Do list feasible—particularly when you advocate for new solutions that make it faster, easier, and less expensive to update systems, compared to lengthy custom development cycles.  APIs are one of these game-changers.  APIs are prebuilt connections that link company systems (such as an ERP, treasury workstation, mobile app, or payment website) directly to bank products and services, for “always on” exchange of information. Unlike batch processing that happens at set timeframes, or portals and file transfers that require user intervention, APIs move information automatically. The result is instant access to banking information, payments, and other services—without downloading files, waiting for reports, or re-entering data between systems.  How to get traction for your API project To get your API initiative on the radar, along with appropriate funding and IT resources,  build your business case with these three steps.  1. Think big First, start by envisioning what success looks like. Document your current systems and processes, then identify the friction points that impede efficiency, accuracy, or customer service.  Look for opportunities such as:  When do you re-enter data? Where do you use multiple systems to complete an activity? How is the current process impacting staff productivity, corporate decision-making, or customer experience?  This is the time to dream big. Ask for input from a variety of roles, from those who “do” the day-to-day work (such as treasury analysts and frontline accounts payable and receivable clerks) to those who make strategic decisions (such as the head of finance). Involve your bank for perspectives from similar organizations and those outside your industry.  2. Start small Next, prioritize your efforts. Take the big picture opportunities from step one and find small yet high value projects that you can complete quickly and easily, with measurable results. The goal is to show stakeholders the value of automation within a few weeks or months, so you can gain credibility, build traction, and continue funding across multiple budget cycles.  Consider the feasibility of API projects like these:  Automating reconciliation with real-time access to balances and transaction details Streamlining vendor payments with instant confirmation that bank accounts are open and valid Implementing a faster payment method for immediate payment needs, such as contractor reimbursements  Once you’ve narrowed your options, invite your bank and your IT team to the table. Review available APIs and develop requirements specific to your use cases and internal systems.  Most importantly, quantify your projected efficiency gains from automating your treasury processes. Depending on the maturity of your company and your business model, this could include supporting rapid growth without needing to hire new staff, or improving productivity to reallocate existing team members to higher value activities.  3. Learn fast To close your business case, focus on timing. APIs are significantly faster to deploy—and easier to learn and use—compared to buying and training users on new systems, or investing in file transfer capabilities. Work with your project team, IT department, and your bank to find a first project that gets you up-and-running quickly. Demonstrate in your business case how you’ll track improvements, measure ROI, and document future opportunities. Stakeholders will appreciate knowing how you’ll apply your learnings to future endeavors and use their corporate support wisely.  Create momentum beyond a single API project Whether you’re looking to expedite payments, receivables, or reconciliation, or simply to mitigate risk by avoiding manual data entry, the benefits of APIs will be immediate and quantifiable. Using a “think big, start small, learn fast” approach will ensure your automation journey starts strong and maintains momentum for years to come.



The swivel.  If you work in a finance function, you’re familiar with it. It’s the endless movement between multiple screens and applications, “swiveling” back and forth to gather information, manually re-enter data, and complete your daily work.  Finally, the end of the swivel is in sight. Companies of all sizes are automating these routine activities with powerful APIs. They’re accelerating access to information, vastly improving efficiency, and making real-time treasury a reality.  Making real-time treasury possible  Just what is real-time treasury? It’s more than a corporate buzzword; it’s the next horizon for finance. Instead of relying on batch processing and next-day timeframes, real-time treasury delivers data as it happens, directly into company systems. It arms stakeholders with the insights needed for strategic decision-making in real time and simplifies the workload for frontline staff.  APIs are central to achieving real-time treasury. These machine-to-machine interfaces relay information with lightning-fast speeds and with “always on” connectivity. Unlike batch processing that happens at set timeframes, or portals and file transfers that require user intervention, APIs move information automatically.  APIs are not new, but they are seeing mainstream adoption. (Wells Fargo introduced our first APIs and our developer gateway in 2016; we now offer more than 40 proven APIs.)  One of the reasons behind the groundswell—particularly at mid-market companies—is the ease of use that APIs offer. With their “plug and play” functionality, APIs require far less time, effort, and IT resources to implement compared to custom development. They’re equally seamless for users, who find the data they need at their fingertips, without cumbersome swiveling between platforms and portals.  Creating value for staff, customers, and suppliers  APIs bring numerous advantages. Employing these system-to-system connections to your bank can help companies:   Do business more easily. APIs reduce the number of steps and systems it takes to accomplish your goals. Employees can work more productively or redeploy their time to higher value activities compared to downloading files and entering data.  Operate in real-time. Instead of waiting minutes, hours, or even days to obtain transaction data, APIs enable instant, “always on” access to critical information. You can spend more time making decisions and less time hunting for data.  Maximize your investment. Using pre-developed and proven functionality can eliminate weeks and even months from your development cycle. APIs work with most systems that treasury already uses, helping you improve ROI and reduce development costs.  Reduce your risk. APIs deliver up-to-the-minute information, making it possible to settle payments instantly, reconcile transactions daily, and spot fraud attempts quickly. In addition, leveraging APIs from regulated financial institutions safeguards your all-important data by ensuring you integrate with secure and compliant endpoints.  Enhance your customer experience. APIs can help you meet—and exceed—the high expectations that customers, suppliers, and employees bring to their daily activities. The flexibility of APIs and numerous pre-developed options let you identify use cases and create the ideal workflow that meets your needs.   API use cases meet broad range of finance needs  Leading banks offer a range of prebuilt APIs designed to facilitate everything from immediate balance inquiries to transacting faster payments to reconciling in real-time. Ongoing customer feedback and collaboration mean new automation options come to market regularly.  Some of the most popular treasury management APIs include:   Instant visibility into available cash balances  Consolidated multi-bank reporting to streamline cash forecasting  Automated posting to your general ledger or client accounts  Issuing and receiving a variety of faster payments, including Same Day ACH, RTPs, and FedNow   Innovative financial institutions also offer APIs that support broader financial activities. These include solutions for working capital management in the capital markets, and ways for organizations with inventory financing to manage approvals and invoices related to their commercial lines of credit. All benefit from the swift and automated exchange of information.  More options, more automation for treasury The evolution of APIs doesn’t end there. Leading banks are working with ERP providers to develop even smarter API functionality that will deliver the data treasury management needs directly into your system-of-record—without extensive IT resources. These “embedded banking” solutions will maximize convenience and simplify implementation.  APIs offer impressive opportunity for businesses to streamline their banking activities and move real-time treasury from vision to reality. Best of all, they signal an end to the “treasury swivel” and a new way to automate, optimize, and use your team’s talents effectively.

[MUSIC UP] Wells Fargo Global Treasury Management Treasury Take A collection of Global Treasury management videos featuring client business leaders sharing knowledge, experience, insights and strategies. What it truly means to digitize your organization Balancing digital changes Adam Rigby  Senior lead Digital Product Manager  Wells Fargo Global Treasury Management Michelle Austin  Chief Financial Officer  Smith Bagley, Inc. Adam Rigby: Digitizing your organization can take a number of different forms. I am Adam Rigby with Wells Fargo and today I have with me Michelle Austin from Smith Bagley, Inc., the Chief Financial Officer, to talk about what her experience has been like digitizing her organization. Michelle, a host of internal and external factors can impact when you make a decision for your organization. Can you talk about what it means to choose between an incremental or transformational change for your business? Michelle Austin: For Smith Bagley, we really haven’t made any transformational changes yet, I think our changes so far have been, you know we’re just getting our feet wet into the digitization and our changes have been minimal. We’ve been able to really offset any costs with some minor changes elsewhere. So, I think, down the road, now that we’re on this path, it’s a great path for us, and I think we’ll be looking for additional changes going forward.  Back to Adam: So, you mentioned costs, can you talk a little about the cost analysis you do when you’re deciding between if I should make a change or stay with the status quo? Back to Michelle: So, within Smith Bagley costs, we don’t have a set aside budget, necessarily, for this digitization in our company. However, what we look at is in terms of efficiencies. So, with the changes, even with the simple ones we’ve made today, we have actually realized some direct cost benefits and time savings benefits. As a small company you know we not able to reduce head count but what we have been able to do is reallocate labor proportionately. Back to Adam: Thank you Michelle, I appreciate you joining us here today. Back to Michelle: You’re very welcome, thanks for having me.

 Criminals thrive on opportunity. They look for weaknesses in systems or processes, then exploit them. When they find a scheme that works, they often deploy it against numerous companies.  Cyber-attacks that follow this pattern appear regularly. Often, threat actors systematically target a specific industry or type of business, wreaking havoc across a single sector. Recent ransomware incidents in the healthcare and services industries such as LockBit offer a prime example.  One way to protect your business is by updating your playbook with a community approach to cyber security.  Expand cyber security beyond your company walls Many businesses have strong internal programs to monitor, detect, and prevent cyber threats. These typically include protocols for company systems, employees, and processes. Communication is also critical. The information security or IT team develops ways to assess risk and share necessary information with company leaders and frontline employee.  Taking cyber security beyond your company walls can arm your business with an additional layer of protection. It may seem counter-intuitive but collaborating with others in your industry or geographic market (and even your competitors) can provide a number of benefits. These advantages include:  Obtaining vital early awareness on new and emerging cyber threats Learning best practices and techniques to improve security Keeping up with new and pending legislation   Invite public and private sector participants Building your community means developing relationships with cyber security professionals outside your company. At first, it may seem strange to work toward a common goal with leaders from other companies. But the more you can find areas of cooperation, the greater the benefit to all involved.  Transparent conversations about what you are seeing or experiencing are key. It also helps to realize that every company will have its own approach to cyber security, and its own tolerance for risk. More sophisticated organizations will likely be more active in monitoring and detecting potential threats, as well as educating others on tactics and best practices.  An effective industry-wide coalition typically includes:  Private sector businesses of all sizes Trade associations Legislative and governing bodies at state and national levels Critical vendors and supply chain resources  Your business still needs an internal cyber security program. However, working together with industry peers helps increase vigilance and resilience for all involved. Industry-wide communication can provide significant muscle to deter threat actors, reduce the impact of cyber-attacks, and decrease risk. 



Dual custody is one of the most effective deterrents against fraud. It requires two users on different computers or mobile devices to initiate and approve online payments and administrative changes, providing a second chance to spot fraud from both internal and external sources before it ever occurs.

By John Hunter, Head of Global Treasury Management Payments and Transaction Services Wells FargoFor companies large and small, real-time speed and efficiency have arrived. Customers and stakeholders now expect immediate access to information, near-instant transactions, and all from the convenience of their preferred device or system.  Creating the treasury infrastructure to make real-time a reality is more valuable than ever. That’s because back-office functions like cash application, supplier payments, forecasting, and reporting now play a bigger, more vital role in a company’s overall brand and customer experience. It’s why more organizations are working proactively with their bank to develop synergies between their treasury platforms, their payment methods, and their core business functions. Too often, however, technology is the only consideration when companies plan a move from batch processing and legacy tools to the new capabilities available with APIs, webhooks, and other real-time solutions.  It’s just as important to fundamentally evolve your treasury processes, skills, and controls. Only with a shift in perspective will you truly maximize the opportunities that real-time solutions present. Future-proof your business with real-time capabilities Innovative real-time capabilities now span a range of functions, from real-time payments to multi-bank dashboards to automated notifications. It’s an exciting time, with leading banks, fintechs, ERP providers, and other players all unveiling new solutions regularly.  Adopting one or more of these capabilities now (and developing a roadmap for future solutions) helps your organization “future-proof” so you can fully support your customers, internal stakeholders, and key business partners.  Other benefits of real-time treasury solutions include:  Automating routine and redundant activities Attracting and retaining key talent Working efficiently and productively Making stronger business decisions, especially around liquidity Creating a competitive advantage in the market  As your organization crafts its real-time strategy, it’s important to realize the impacts of automation, speed, and visibility to your treasury processes and team. Rethinking the following three elements will set your organization up for success.  1. Rethink your processes Real-time operations dramatically accelerate the speed at which treasury operates. APIs help you replace batch processing, intraday or next-day reporting, and painstaking downloads of data with real-time transactions and instant access to information. Instead of swiveling between numerous platforms, spreadsheets, and portals, you can embed key functionality within your core back-office system—or even your customer-facing applications.  The switch to real-time means rethinking your processes. For example:  What does faster access to information and greater automation mean for staff who apply cash or do cash flow forecasting?  What risk management checkpoints, approvals, and controls need to change in order to safeguard company funds and data in a real-time environment?  How will working capital and liquidity management processes improve? How will your cash application processes change to accommodate real-time payments received on weekends or holidays?  Looking at these and other work flows can help you apply real-time treasury across your customer, supplier, and employee experiences.  2. Rethink your skills Historically, working in finance meant building out spreadsheets, moving data between systems, and even manual activities like printing and mailing customer invoices. Treasury management, accounts receivable, and accounts payable all hired team members versed in these routine tasks.  Now, there’s far more automation. As your organization adopts new solutions, it’s smart to rethink the skillsets you need and how you can redeploy your staff. With current, accurate information at your fingertips, there’s a greater need for those fluent in critical thinking, financial analysis, managing technology, and interpreting data; those who manually process payments, print checks, and reconcile accounts may need upskilling and education for the future.  3. Rethink your technology How your company manages systems is the final area to rethink. Fortunately, APIs and other real-time tools require fewer IT resources and far less investment, compared to custom development efforts of the past. That puts real-time within reach of small and large organizations alike.  It also expands the reach of treasury solutions. Real-time brings treasury beyond the back-office operations and into sales, customer service, and even product development. Rethinking your technology means taking a big picture approach, strengthening relationships across the organization, and working with the right external resources who can bring your business goals to life.  Minimize complexity by working with trusted providers Your bank can play a vital role in your transformation to real-time. You can minimize complexity by working through a few trusted resources rather than sourcing solutions from numerous, disconnected vendors. You can also transact with confidence, especially as more real-time transactions settle with irrevocable terms. It’s vital to safeguard both your data and funds at all points; your financial institution understands and adheres to strict regulations, with powerful fraud-fighting tools. Your bank can even operate as the “connective tissue” that links you to various payment networks, digital wallets, and other innovations that will streamline your workload and power your customer experiences.

Impostor fraud, also known as business email compromise (BEC), occurs when a criminal impersonates someone you know and trust such as a vendor, executive, or the IRS. The impostor contacts you by phone, email, fax, or postal mail and submits an invoice or requests a payment or a change to vendor payment instructions. This results in your payment going to the fraudster rather than where you intended. Unlike other types of fraud, impostor fraud is difficult to detect because the transactions made on your account are consistent with regular payments and are made by authorized personnel. Always verify sensitive requests using this checklist to help ensure you don’t miss an important step. Download checklist (PDF)



Kate Lewis, Accounts Receivable Specialist, started her job at Litehouse Inc. at the right time. Just weeks before, the food manufacturer launched Integrated Receivables (IR) from Wells Fargo. The sophisticated solution quickly transformed the company’s accounts receivable (AR), fully automating 95 percent of their U.S. cash application.  What often took her predecessor a full day, Lewis now handles in 1-2 hours. Gone are cumbersome spreadsheets, manual data entry, and hours spent tracking down details. Wells Fargo’s flexible IR tool applies the power of artificial intelligence and machine learning to expedite the company’s AR processes.  Bringing scale and efficiency to AR Wendy Gibson, Senior Accountant, manages Litehouse’s AR team. After 24 years with the company, working from their Sandpoint, Idaho, headquarters, she recognizes the scale, efficiency, and benefits that automation creates.  In a typical month, IR now automates the processing of more than $21 million in receivables. In a typical month, IR automates an average of 2,000 invoices per month and corresponding check and electronic payments resulting in significant time savings for the Litehouse Inc. team.  “I saw the IR implementation and I was blown away at how fast and easy it was!” Gibson said. “What used to take a person nearly all day—and sometimes into the next day—now can be done in just the morning hours.” Automation is nothing new to Litehouse. Prior to adding IR, they deployed Wells Fargo’s Payment Manager solution to streamline accounts payable (AP). “It works really well,” Gibson explained. “IR is the same concept, bringing in and matching payments automatically. To add receivables and get efficiencies here has been awesome.” Eliminating spreadsheets, manual work, and all-day effort Founded more than 60 years ago, Litehouse has grown from a local institution to a nationwide powerhouse. Their flagship products include a variety of high-quality salad dressings, dips, and salsas found in grocery stores, cafeterias, and restaurant chains around the country.  Processing the invoices and payments associated with a food service business, however, means nuances not found in other industries. With large customers, for example, a single check can cover dozens or even hundreds of open invoices. Customers also routinely apply discounts to their payments, reflecting everything from early payment to products damaged during delivery.  Unraveling those details required patience and hard work for Litehouse. The company uses a specialized ERP for manufacturers. While the system contains fields for discounts and other notes, the AR team could not apply cash directly in the ERP. First, they needed to match payments and open invoices, then balance each day’s cash in an Excel spreadsheet.  “The old way, you had to type everything into a spreadsheet, make sure everything balanced, and it was very cumbersome and time consuming,” Gibson recalled.  She added, “It used to take all day, and sometimes into the next day. We’d all have to pitch in and get caught up.” Automation reduces aging from millions of dollars to under $500,000 Now, only Canadian payments require a spreadsheet, and Litehouse looks forward to automating them with IR in the future.  Gibson and Lewis cite numerous advantages with IR, from reduced Days Sales Outstanding (DSO) and accelerated collections to greater productivity in the AR team.  “A year ago, our aging was very high—and now our 60-day report has shrunk from a few million dollars to under $500,000,” Gibson said. “Part of that is because Kate can get payments in, then move on to collections faster.” Lewis agrees. Her strength is collections; being able to apply each day’s cash quickly gives her ample time to for outreach to customers and other activities that create a positive impact on the bottom line.  “It’s the time factor,” Lewis explained. “If I had to post everything manually, it would take all day. IR gives me time to do other things—specifically collections and some deductions—without needing another person.” Managing growth without adding FTEs Senior management also appreciates the benefits of IR, especially the savings it creates as the company continues to expand. Litehouse Inc. has grown to include five owned brands and a handful of exciting licensing partners, like California Pizza Kitchen. IR has enabled Litehouse’s small AR team—just four specialists for invoicing, deductions, cash application, and collections—to keep up with the pace and they now have more capacity for other core activities.   “We’re just growing out of sight, but Integrated Receivables has helped us scale our business without needing to hire more  headcount,” Gibson said. “We would have needed another person to do collections if we kept working manually.” Gibson’s pride in their accomplishments comes from being not just the manager of AR, but a stakeholder in Litehouse’s future. The organization is 100% employee-owned, sharing values of integrity, stewardship, accountability, and excellence. Using IR helps them achieve these goals.  She encourages other organizations to make the switch to IR. Her advice?  “I’d tell them get with this century! We’re all looking for new efficiencies, and this is the way to go,” Gibson said. Lewis concurred, adding, “Integrated Receivables makes the process so time efficient—it really has been amazing.”



 FDA approval is a foundational requirement for many products developed by pharmaceutical and other healthcare startups, however a lot more preparation is required for commercial success. To create financial value, it is important that Pharma and Health Tech companies execute a well-orchestrated go-to-market strategy. Unfortunately, many companies, large and small, fail in this process due to both poor preparation and misjudging the complexities of scaling an organization quickly enough to seize the opportunities created by a successful product. Evolving Challenges since COVID-19  It is estimated that at least 90% of all startups fail which is representative of the healthcare market as well: 90% of startups in the healthcare market will fail or be “aqui-hired” (acquiring a company’s talent) within 2-5 years of launching. For Healthcare and Pharma startups, the product itself is rarely the problem: Failure is often the result of an unclear business model, the lack of a clear go-to-market strategy, or a poorly defined value proposition. During the COVID-19 pandemic, many investors looked to the public health and infectious disease space as the next big opportunity, but the obstacles facing these startups were even greater than in other sectors. Not surprisingly, the main challenges which startups usually face include finding customers and securing the investments needed for their innovations. During the pandemic when compared with pre-pandemic data, these challenges increased by 20% and 8% respectively. Post the COVID-19 pandemic, new capital has become increasingly harder to access and even more expensive due to increased risk in a volatile rate environment. While funding is still available, it has become more competitive than ever to gain investors' trust and investments. Venture Capital funds have begun looking more closely at underlying business models, growth strategies, and how successful products will be when launched at scale. Business Planning and Quality Control While influence in the industry and comprehensive business planning can increase the odds of commercial success, there are many circumstances out of our start-up clients’ control, including: the timing of an FDA approval, potential changes in regulation which might not get past the comment period or may require multiple iterations, delays in the next funding rounds, etc. Despite these points of uncertainty, a company can control the quality and efficacy of its business processes and controls, in addition to how it poises itself for success within its specialty. Investors are just as much interested in the efficacy of the product as the foundation and direction of the organization overall. Especially the finance and treasury function can use the time before the FDA approval to get business processes in order and look for opportunities to build out scalable processes. Examples of foundations which should be set early on include Finance and Treasury functions; taking advantage of the timeframe prior to FDA approval will allow a smooth implementation of business processes, thereby allowing for more opportunities to build out scalable processes. Cash flow is another particular financial measure to keep an eye on during periods of growth, especially in circumstances where additional venture funding is slower than in previous years, so paying careful attention to timing of cash flow will pay off now and in the future. By being attentive at the key moments to Treasury and Finance metrics, the growth trajectory of a startup can increase sustainably, keeping the interest of investors. Key infrastructure components which will need to be reviewed and put in place are the ERP system, HR platform, and digital payments ecosystem. Let’s look at each one in more detail and highlight how these relate to the high growth enablement. HR, ERP, and Electronic Payments  The implementation of an HR system to automate the HR related processes and functions of a startup are significant, and can occur either on a standalone basis, or an integrated one within the ERP. When set-up correctly, many HR related functions can be automated such as recruiting and training new employees, hiring, benefits administration, performance management, payroll, and tracking of compliance requirements. Especially in times of accelerated hiring and onboarding of new employees, the HR system needs to be scalable and compliant with the applicable state and federal regulations. ERP and HR applications are held to high cyber security standards are paramount in protecting proprietary and patient data for your startup. Many hosted and cloud-based solutions of HR and ERP systems support pay-as-you go models which reduce the need for an upfront investment and leave the operations of the systems and certain cyber security matters to third party providers. The third component involves setting up electronic payments and receivables processes that integrate with the aforementioned ERP and HR system. To ensure scalability, manual and paper-based processes should be avoided for these responsibilities. Electronic bank statements and commercial card files should be inputted into the ERP automatically to support auto reconciliation and identify exceptions, both of which would identify fraud quickly. If travel is a major requirement, a commercial travel card program will need to be established early on and will also need to support controls that align with policies and avoid sales practice issues. Pricing and Billing Models It is also important to think about different pricing and billing models early on which will need to be supported as part of the go-to-market strategy. Flexibility of the billing platform and integration into the Account Receivables process will be important in reducing lost revenue and in avoiding granting unwarranted discounts. Once a new product is on the market questions arise such as:    How will orders be created? What payment terms will be offered to different distributors of the product and how will adherence be tracked Is a sales force or regional representation required to promote the new product across the US or even internationally? Will discounts be provided for certain markets?  Once actual sales start taking place, a key metric which should be tracked is days receivables outstanding or DSO which measures the time it takes to collect receivables once invoices are issued. The first step in taking control of DSO starts by automating the invoicing and collection process and consider solutions that match incoming payments to remittance data automatically. To optimize DSO further, receivables financing solutions can also be reviewed, thus releasing cash as well as managing the risk on the companies’ balance sheet. On the payable side, the goal is to optimize the days payables outstanding (DPO). When the pay is too slow, discount may be missed, and when pay is too quick, there may be impact to the available cash. One option to extend payment timelines without jeopardizing supplier relationships can be the use of virtual cards to give suppliers immediate payment while the company retains its working capital up to 30 days. Data Protection and Privacy In addition to technology and reliable data, a scalable business will require policies and controls that need to be established and documented early in the lifecycle of the company.  Controls need to be enforced and their effectiveness will depend on the data quality and by the business workflows which the ERP and HR systems enforce consistently across the organization. In addition to good clinical practice (GCP), product safety and manufacturing policies, other policies, and controls to consider are:  Data protection and privacy policy governs how sensitive information such as personal data and confidential business information will be protected Information security policy outlines how information systems, networks, and data will be protected from unauthorized access, theft, and cyberattacks and what to do in case of a breach Compliance policy specifies the company's compliance with relevant laws and regulations including DA, EMA, and other regulatory agencies. Investment Policy governs investment objectives, asset allocation, risk tolerance, diversification and any restrictions Data Quality Policy sets procedures for ensuring the accuracy, completeness, and reliability of data across the organization HR policies covers Recruitment and hiring, Compensation and Benefits, Time Off and Leaves of Absence, and Health and Safety Accounting and Finance policies governs financial reporting, internal controls, revenue recognition, accounts receivable, accounts payable, cash management, budgeting, and tax planning  Well documented policies and controls, combined with the right technology will not only enable the company to grow its operation to scale quickly but also to confidently establish SOX reporting that can hold up to the scrutiny of external auditors, and also prepare the organization for their public filings when the time comes. Significance of Data in Securing Capital According to Deloitte, “…products and solutions that address well-being and care delivery, along with open, secure data and interoperable platforms, are likely to continue receiving the lion’s share of funding”. In addition to providing capital, investors and strategic partners should assume a consultative role, and bring their industry and regulatory experience to innovative startups. Advancing with technology and automation, enforcing policies and controls, establishing a unique value proposition, and most importantly, having a clear business model will all determine the success of a healthcare startup. When partnered with the best investors and consultants for them, innovators can continue to grow, improve quality of care, and deliver value to patients for a better future in healthcare. Investing in the readiness many months or years before the formal authorization is received by the FDA might not be intuitive but lacking the capabilities and functions will lead to performance challenges or avoidable risk exposures that can hurt the future success of the company. Creating the above-mentioned functions on the fly seldomly work and unreliable financial data will most certainly impact obtaining further funding, a public offering or sale of the company. To be successful, a company needs to find common ground with investors, customers, health care providers, patients, and potential acquirers early and often. Stakeholder input is needed early to avoid mistakes that can impede any chance of a success a company may have later down the road. Health care companies are required to amass specific evidence and data to achieve key milestones such as raising capital, regulatory clearance or approval, and obtaining insurance reimbursement or payment. A common mistake is thinking about evidence generation in a linear manner and focusing just on what is needed for the next milestone. This is a common and costly error that can significantly delay time to success. Far too many startups succeed in achieving a regulatory milestone but then run out of funding before generating sufficient evidence to convince customers to buy their products so effective budget planning and allocating is key when it comes to evidence generation. To avoid errors such as this, start conversations early with all relevant stakeholders about what data they will require. Also consider the Food and Drug Administration’s innovative Payor Communication Task Force; this task force involves public and private payers such as Medicare and Medicaid, private health plans, health technology assessment groups, and others in the pre-submission process in conjunction with a parallel review with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to potentially shorten the time between FDA approval and coverage decisions. It’s essential to know who will be paying for your products and how the reimbursement will work. Misunderstanding the complicated and ever-changing economics of payment reimbursements is a costly, and easy one to make. Many health care startups develop a strategy that will let them sell straight to consumers, thinking that it would be a simpler model. They assume this way they are able to skip the time and expense consuming regulatory approval. Angel investors with small pockets tend to favor this strategy. The problem is that this relies on the often-flawed assumption that consumers are willing to pay out of pocket for health-related products and services. Excluding the outliers who are early adopters of the out-of-pocket payments, most consumers naturally want their health plans to pay. As a result, consumer health startups often wind-up pivoting strategies in order to pursue a regulated device strategy, but many run out of the necessary funds before they get there. Making an informed decision on payments strategy early on will help to determine whether your startup will perform better by offering its innovations as regulated or as non-regulated products. Know Your Customers and all indications for your innovations We regularly see startups whose technology has multiple potential indications however they typically choose the initial indication based on the one the company founder knows the most about — a founder who is a liver cancer surgeon, for example, choosing liver cancer over breast cancer. This type of decision making isn’t always the right call, and the evidence generated in an incorrect initial indication can drain resources before you even have the chance to pivot. To arrive at the best indication, complete a value proposition analysis on all indications and choose the one which is the most compelling in terms of market size, competitive landscape, and patient adoption. These qualifiers should help inform the decision on which indication to initially prioritize and pursue. After arriving at this stage, you may think your technology will be adopted because of the potential for improved patient outcomes or lowering overall costs, but if it adds steps or changes a procedure for the ones who are administering your product or service, you are not just disrupting an industry, but the key stakeholders and decision makers. To have the greatest chance at success, the innovative health technology should integrate as seamlessly as possible into existing workflows, not delay, or interrupt them. Therefore, it’s essential to take ownership of knowing the details of every step and aspect of a customer’s workflow including every person who will be affected by it, because one weak link in the new process can potentially prevent your innovation from being adopted. For example, a surgeon may love your technology, but if it impacts a Nurse’s or Technician’s shift workload then an adoption hurdle will loom. Simulating conduct discovery, focus groups, and user testing with every key player in the actual impacted workflow in as many situations as possible can help clarify any pain points or inefficiencies before they become an obstacle in a live environment. Being mindful of the learning points outlined in this white paper should give you a clear starting point of which pain points in your growth you may anticipate and can tackle ahead of time with your business advisory team. Staying proactive in your business strategy at every stage, maintaining a strong brand vision, offering scalable products and services adaptable to serve multiple customer types are paramount for any healthcare startup. What is even more beneficial in addition to what all strong startups have is ensuring that all key stakeholders in your company structure have a comprehensive understanding of all payment and reimbursement dynamic options which are usually moving targets. Wells Fargo is here to help support all aspects of your startup through this exciting, innovative journey and will help you make your mark on the future of positive global healthcare outcomes. Your relationship manager will be pleased to provide more information on Wells Fargo’s financial strategies for the healthcare industry and other correspondent services.



Historically, automating tasks involved removing the people from processes. Today, digital transformation considers the human factor to be essential to systems design. Nowhere is this more vital than in fighting fraud. Key to success requires understanding the relationship between people and technology and developing systems and processes to enable people to supervise automated tasks. When automation alienates  While automation can streamline and simplify, it also often changes the tasks at hand. What was routine for employees can become unfamiliar or even more complex. For example, file encryption can add new steps. Shifting from in-person to online meetings introduces new processes. Technology typically changes how people fit into their environment, and this can be disruptive.  Trust but verify When it comes to fraud detection, every second counts. Technology is a key tool in fast detection. However, sometimes we blindly trust technology. If something doesn’t look right, we may overly rely on what machines tell us is happening while ignoring our common sense.   It’s important to trust but verify your technology. Human intuition is a key skill in early fraud detection and in critical thinking that can help to prevent fraud.   When introducing automation to fight fraud, the human element becomes more, not less important. People must remain a critical part of digital transformation. Even companies that invest in artificial intelligence should not lose sight of the value of human intelligence. Add sensemaking to your fraud detection arsenal Intuitive skills can help us to understand connections between information, circumstances, and our actions so that we can recognize situations, detect problems, and understand how to adapt and respond. This cognitive process is known as sensemaking.  If you are increasing your reliance on automation to detect fraud, human sensemaking becomes an important counterbalance. If you can’t afford to invest in technology, and your people remain your only front-line fraud defense, sensemaking is a particularly valuable skill.  Train employee intuition Making sense takes common sense. However, intuition can be an especially powerful resource when trained. How do you train your people in sensemaking?  Allow employees to trust but verify technology as part of their daily routine. Develop procedures and protocols that support this approach, and train people to follow them. Put checks and balances in place, such as reviewing key reports regularly. Build controls into your technology.  For example, include a human override or kill switch that pauses an automated process from advancing without approval. Cultivate employees not only as sensers but as innovators. It’s important to rely on employees not only to sense when something is wrong but to suggest better procedures. Establish a culture where employees feel comfortable to speak up when they find a better way of doing things, not only for detecting fraud but for preventing it. Training and educational opportunities support this kind of environment.  People are a key factor in fraud detection. Digital transformation aimed at fighting fraud should be designed with human oversight in mind. As part of this, it’s important to cultivate the ability for employees to sense when something is not right and to act accordingly.



With sales and other functions curtailed, payments are crucial to business viability, now may be the time to enhance your accounts receivable and payable by implementing the following strategies. Refine accounts receivable Move to electronic receivables. Checks require people to be physically present to handle them. If you’ve been meaning to move to electronic payments for efficiency reasons, this is a good reason to do it now. Talk to customers about paying you by ACH, RTP, or online, and redesign invoices to show your preferred payment methods. Talk to your bank about setting up electronic receivables services. Post unapplied payments. You want customers to buy from you again, and soon. Open their receivable accounts by researching and posting unapplied payments. Update your receivables accounts. Remove inactive accounts and duplicates. A clean list may help make processing payments faster and easier and help avoid exceptions. Review past-due accounts. Connecting with your customers is important. If they can’t pay the full amount, perhaps offer discounts or set up payment plans. You may want to add or assign resources to help bring in needed cash. Hone accounts payable Make more payments electronically. If you’re having trouble printing checks, your customers are having trouble receiving them. Offer electronic payment options such as ACH, RTP, and commercial card. Reach out to suppliers. If you have invoices that are difficult to process, tell your suppliers how they may help make your invoice processing easier. It may be as simple as including the P.O. number or invoice number on their bills. Clean up master vendor files. Vendor contact names, phone numbers, addresses, and terms keep changing. To help avoid duplicate payments and business email compromise (BEC) fraud, validate the information on file, remove duplicates, and archive inactive vendors. Handle uncashed checks. No one wants checks to go into escheatment. If you have checks uncashed past their stale dates, try to contact payees to learn why they haven’t been cashed. Moving away from check payments to electronic payments can lessen the likelihood of creating unclaimed property. Prepare for exigencies to come After Superstorm Sandy, the Great Recession, COVID-19, and more, who knows what’s coming next. Increase your preparedness with these BCP measures. Write or update standard operating procedures (SOPS). When you have turnover or absenteeism, structured process management will enable business as usual. Cross-train employees. Build bench strength so jobs will get done when the usual team members are unavailable. Conduct fraud training. Businesses are more vulnerable to fraud in times of turmoil. Increase fraud awareness – especially awareness of business email compromise fraud – through video conferencing or meetings. As you implement these best practices, you may gain insights into where and how you might improve your processes. Insights you can put into action when normalcy returns.



 As businesses navigate the current economic landscape, their treasurers are facing an increasingly complex and volatile environment. Two key areas of concern are the implications of high interest rates and supply chain risks. These factors can impact a company's liquidity position and working capital, making effective management of these areas of critical importance. High Interest Rates Interest rates are a crucial component of the financial system, influencing borrowing costs, savings rates, and investment returns. When interest rates rise, there are implications for treasurers, with two primary ways that high-interest rates can impact a business’s finances.  Firstly, the cost of refinancing debt increases. As interest rates rise, the cost of borrowing for companies also goes up. With 78.8% of investment-grade U.S. corporate debt maturing this year, the impact of higher borrowing costs for companies to refinance their debt can impact their cash flows and profitability. Treasurers need to assess the implications of rising interest rates on their organization’s debt servicing costs and develop strategies to mitigate the impact. At times like this, access to excess cash reserves and optimizing receivables management become paramount. Secondly, treasurers need to re-evaluate their hedging strategies. These could be both on and off-balance sheet. The more obvious hedges companies can take advantage of are where companies enter derivative hedging contracts to manage interest rate risk. When interest rates increase, the value of these contracts may change triggering calls on cash. There also remain the need for hedging embedded risks in a company’s supply chain. Supply Chain Risks The pandemic has disrupted global supply chains, increasing the focus on diversifying the supplier base and near-shoring production centers. However, these strategies also come with their own set of potential risks, such as increased freight costs, fewer discounts due to lower individual purchase orders and foreign exchange risk. Adding to this could be the differing approaches by central banks in their response to inflation and subsequent rate hikes which have increased volatility in the foreign exchange markets. All of this could trigger re-pricing clauses in supply contracts, increasing the demand for cash to fund payables. Managing Liquidity Positions and Working Capital Given the uncertainties in the current economic environment, treasurers should adopt a proactive approach to managing their liquidity positions and working capital. Some strategies that treasurers could use to manage their liquidity positions and working capital effectively include: 1. Improve visibility on cash flows and off-balance sheet liabilities Treasurers should have a clear understanding of their cash flow requirements and develop robust cash flow forecasting models to manage their liquidity positions effectively. Treasurers should work closely with the business development and procurement teams to advise them on the re-pricing risks embedded in supply contracts and to thereafter include these contingent liabilities into their cash flow projections. These should be considered when procurement might not be able to lock in pricing for future deliveries creating uncertainty for cash outflows and their timing. 2. Optimize working capital across the supply chain Treasurers should work closely with their procurement and supply chain teams to optimize their working capital, as they could potentially reduce the amount of cash tied up in inventory and accounts receivable and have plans ready to extend payables if required. 3. Work closely with suppliers Given the supply chain risks, treasurers may work closely with suppliers through their procurement teams to ensure they are meeting their contractual obligations and to develop contingency plans in case of disruptions and shipping delays even as their companies execute plans to diversify their supplier base. 4. Consider alternative financing options Treasurers could consider alternative financing options, such as factoring or supply chain finance, to improve their liquidity positions. Smaller companies could benefit from supplier financing if the supplier has lower financing costs. For smaller ticket items, corporate purchase card programs could be considered. 5. Work closely with their bank Treasurers should review their bank’s capital, short term liquidity metrics, and discuss their lending capacity. Treasurers should ensure that their bank is aware of any refinancing or new financing plans. Conclusion The current economic environment is characterized by high interest rates and supply chain risks, making it critical for treasurers to manage their liquidity positions and working capital effectively. By focusing on cash flow forecasting, optimizing working capital, refocusing on supply chain risks, and considering alternative financing options, treasurers can mitigate the impact of these risks on their working capital in an effort to ensure that their organizations remain financially stable.



With rates rising and the cost of funds increasing, there’s a new sense of urgency for companies to improve efficiency, reduce expenses, and maximize liquidity. Centralizing some or all treasury management functions, such as cash management, helps achieve this goal.  Transforming treasury operations is not a new concept. However, it’s become more critical as treasury management’s role in the organization grows more strategic.  A centralized treasury structure provides greater visibility, improves control, and automates and streamlines processes. It arms senior leaders with the information and systems needed to make insightful decisions and act quickly. Centralizing cash management yields many benefits Cash management is one of the best places to centralize because the benefits will be immediate and tangible. It enables you to access your daily cash position quickly and easily, then make strategic decisions about excess funds and idle cash with speed and agility.  Numerous other benefits are possible with a centralized structure. Treasury can take advantage of:  Standard processes, controls, and metrics across the entire organization that streamline daily work, reduce risk, and improve treasury’s line of sight.  A single entity managing risk, which simplifies counterparty relationships and lets global organizations take greater advantage of natural hedging for foreign exchange (FX). Stronger working capital and liquidity management which can minimize external borrowing requirements and increase return on equity (ROE). Increased operational efficiencies, made possible with fewer bank accounts to manage, optimal FTE staffing, and for more sophisticated companies, shared service centers for payables, receivables, and other transactions.  Move toward centralization with these fundamental first steps Moving away from a decentralized structure can seem overwhelming. But, like many journeys, the hardest part is often figuring out where to begin.  First, establish your company’s long-term vision for centralization. Use your bank as a resource at this stage—they can help you compare options, share best practices, and provide insight into how similar companies handle their cash management and liquidity. Next, identify discrete short-term projects that are manageable in scope and can deliver measurable results. Consider these key elements: Get buy-in from stakeholders. No strategic project works well without top-down support. Enlist C-suite and line of business leaders for sponsorship and input, then keep them up-to-date on progress and early wins. Rationalize your bank accounts. Start with an inventory of banks and accounts across the organization. Identify the type and purpose of each, along with ownership and signatory capabilities. Look at currencies as well. This exercise will help you standardize across entities, ensure the right controls are in place, and as needed, consolidate for more efficient banking relationships and liquidity management.  Evaluate local versus central control. Centralizing cash management and other treasury management functions doesn’t have to be “all or nothing.” Hybrid options can give ownership to local entities while simultaneously automating processes, strengthening oversight, and improving cash management. Work with your bank to understand your options, then match strategies to your desired level of control.  Review technology options. In the past, centralizing meant arduous IT integrations and lengthy timeframes. Today, even in-house banks require very little IT effort, thanks to cloud-based solutions, real-time connectivity with APIs, and automated ledger entries. Achieving your goals may be faster and more cost-effective than you think, with banks, fintechs, and ERP providers all delivering “plug and play” solutions.  Take advantage of early wins Just as the journey image implies, change and centralization won’t happen overnight. But, every decision that standardizes a process, automates a workflow, or centralizes access to cash will help treasury operate more effectively. Set appropriate expectations with stakeholders, then work with your bank to find early wins you can measure, celebrate, and build from.



First, there were electronic transactions with next business day settlement. Then faster payments arrived, revolutionizing how companies and consumers move money. Now, two instant payment methods push speed and availability even faster: RTP® from The Clearing House® and the upcoming FedNowSM service.  Both platforms can help companies reach domestic DDA accountholders 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year, with irrevocable transactions. RTPs allow payments up to $1 million; FedNow will launch with a $500,000 per-transaction limit.  With so many choices in the market, many treasury professionals are asking, should we deploy RTP now? Or wait until 2023 and adopt FedNow? Which method is best for our disbursement needs? Instead of taking a “wait and see” approach, there’s good reason for businesses to consult with their banks now to make sure you’re maximizing the opportunity presented by instant payment methods. Savvy financial institutions are working side-by-side with payment providers and customers to make using these new methods as seamless as possible.  Gain a competitive advantage with instant payments Instant payment rails like RTP and FedNow empower businesses to send and receive payments within seconds, giving payees almost immediate access to the funds.  This speed and control provides a number of potential benefits: Stronger liquidity management. Instant payments can reduce uncertainty from payment delays and boost working capital, helping businesses strengthen liquidity management and reduce the need for excess cash on hand to cover emergencies or float. Greater customer and supplier satisfaction. No matter who your business pays, reducing the time and effort it takes to receive funds makes a difference. Paying time-sensitive contracts or insurance claims with instant transaction capabilities, for example, can improve your brand experience and even be a competitive differentiator.  Reduced friction across the payment process. Instant payments not only settle faster, they also make invoicing, deposits, posting, and other accounting activities easier. Unlike checks or other payment types, there’s less need for data entry or research to apply payments. “Request for payment” functionality can even eliminate invoicing. Use instant payments when speed, accuracy, and finality matter How will you know which instant payment methods are right for your organization? Start by considering your use cases. Instant payments like FedNow and RTP work best when speed, accuracy, and finality are critical to the transaction.  Early adopters use instant payments for scenarios like these:  Mortgage and lending payoffs at closing Insurance claims settlements to policyholders Emergency payroll and gig employee payouts for the company workforce Merger and acquisition transactions Time-sensitive payments to key suppliers  Next, work with your bank to understand the requirements for issuing instant payments via The Clearing House and the Federal Reserve. Connectivity will be important, as these transactions may require an alternative to daily batch processing.  Payee preference is another factor. Providing your suppliers and customers with options for instant payment can lead to greater satisfaction with your organization. Look for bank tools that help you with payment “decisioning” so you can serve your payees well, without adding extra workload for your team. An instant payments engine lets you send transaction details, while your bank helps manage the process of routing each disbursement through the best instant payments network for your business need.  Lastly, consider the impacts of non-refutable transactions. How will you update your internal treasury management policies and controls, and set appropriate permissions and limits in your systems, so you’re assured your payments reach the correct recipients? Leveraging dual controls, account validation, and other services will help everyone in your company transact with confidence.  Modernize your payments experience In the blink of an eye, it’s now possible to move money safely, efficiently, and conveniently. RTPs and FedNow help your business enjoy these benefits and stay current with the latest instant payment options.

Transcript: Treasury Take: The path to digitization

[MUSIC UP]  Wells Fargo Global Treasury Management  Treasury Take  A collection of Global Treasury management videos featuring client business leaders sharing knowledge, experience, insights and strategies.  What it truly means to digitize your organization  The path to digitization  Adam Rigby  Senior lead Digital Product Manager  Wells Fargo Global Treasury Management  Michelle Austin  Chief Financial Officer  Smith Bagley, Inc.  Adam Rigby: Digitizing your organization can take a number of different forms. I am Adam Rigby with Wells Fargo and today I have with me Michelle Austin from Smith Bagley, Inc, the Chief Financial Officer, to talk about what her experience has been like digitizing her organization. Can you talk a little bit about where you are in your company's journey today?  Michelle Austin: Yes, at Smith Bagley, back in 2020, during the pandemic we realized that we really needed a solution to pay our vendors remotely. And so, in 2021 looked and met with a number of different solutions and in 2022 actually implemented a consolidated file process. What that does for us is allows us, our staff, to be 100% remote. We basically take an open payables file and transform that through some help from our MIS department. And that then is uploaded in into the file portal and from there all the payments are done by a third-party vendor. So, it’s been a great solution for us. It’s allowed us, like I said, some efficiencies, in addition to doing something that doesn’t matter if we have staff in the office or not.  Back to Adam: Can you talk a little bit about what it means for your AP team in terms of efficiency because you’ve implemented that change?  Back to Michelle: It’s been great, so our team can work, like I said, 100% remote. I don’t have to worry about having people in the office to get the check stock, sign the checks, stuff the checks, put them in the mail. Saved us some direct costs obviously for all the same reasons, and it’s allowed us really to repurpose that labor. So, we’ve got staff today that used to spend their time doing the very manual tasks that I just described and now they can focus on more important things.  Back to Adam: Thank you Michelle, I appreciate you joining us here today.  Back to Michelle: You’re very welcome.

Michelle is going to talk to us a little bit about what it’s been like at her organization to digitize her business. Michelle, as you’ve been evaluating traditional processes vs digitization options. What have you been weighing in as the pros and cons for the alternatives?  Michelle Austin: Well, what I would like to see for our organization is ultimately, we would have a system for the accounts payable side where we have our invoices come in electronically. We have them processed and sent out remotely to the approvers, and then they come back into our AP system, and that would all be done through AI.  On the receivables side, a similar process where we can do reconciliations electronically and then consolidation of our payment streams.  We receive a number of payments from our customers through various forms and so looking for a way to consolidate all of that through AI on the backend as well, that would be great.  Obviously, the technology has to be balanced with the cost.

By John Hunter, Head of Global Treasury Management Payments and Transaction Services Wells Fargo   The era of “real time” has arrived. Speed has changed our lives dramatically compared to just a few years ago, impacting everything from sending and receiving funds in an instant, to streaming live content, to checking the status of your order with a simple click. “Now” is the new normal; waiting is no longer an option.   Yet in many finance departments it’s still business as usual. Payments, reporting, and liquidity management all rely on the same day-old (or older) data, the same batch processing and manual operations that were “leading edge” more than a decade ago.  Setting a new standard for cash management  If your treasury seems trapped in the past, it’s definitely time to move forward. Instant access to data can revolutionize your company’s financial operations, as well as your customer, supplier, and employee experiences. Considering your options now, as well as involving your bank in planning will ensure you keep pace with the latest developments as they become available.  Innovations in technology make real-time enhancements possible, leveling the playing field for smaller organizations. In the past, only large and sophisticated companies could invest in custom ERP upgrades and system-to-system connectivity. Now, real-time tools like APIs and webhooks, greater adoption of industry standards, and the leadership of key banks are all helping to simplify and democratize real-time access.  New solutions will be scalable for small and medium-sized businesses as well as global enterprises. The result is a new standard for real-time cash management.  7 ways to accelerate progress  Consider opportunities like these for treasury management to put real-time connectivity into practical application.   Imagine making liquidity decisions and mobilizing your cash based on up-to-the-minute balances pulled from accounts at multiple banks. Imagine simplifying your transactions, so each payment uses the method that’s fastest, safest, and most cost-effective.  Imagine making customer service a great experience with automatic notifications and real-time transaction status, all from within your product or mobile app.   There’s even more potential on the horizon as banks and fintechs continue innovating. We’re excited about these seven scenarios: 1. Route your payments efficiently The options for sending and receiving transactions continue to grow, adding complexity and at times, cost. When you have a handful of critical payments, it’s feasible to research the most efficient method (such as wires, Same Day ACH, RTP, or the new FedNow network). But scaling those decisions for larger payment volumes requires substantial information, processing power, and automation.  Enter intelligent routing. With a solution like this, you and your bank will create business rules specific to your priorities, whether you need speed of settlement, lowest processing cost, international reach, or other capabilities. Then, your bank’s payment platform will deploy the best transaction method. The delivery industry already employs this type of tool with great success, letting smart technology recommend the best carrier and delivery timeframe for shipments – so why not do the same with your payments.  2. Detect fraud attempts instantly What if instant access to data could better protect your funds? Your bank, your fraud protection services, and the payment networks you use already collect and monitor thousands of datapoints in real-time. Imagine accessing this sophisticated intelligence to spot potential fraud and misuse before a payment occurs. Real-time connectivity can power this type of solution in the near future. For example, if you’ve never before made a payment in Asia, or if your standard transaction is $5,000 not $50,000, a real-time fraud protection service could detect anomalies and notify your team before you issue the payment. With more irrevocable transactions and real-time settlement, it will be an important safeguard to put on your treasury “must have” list.  3. Reduce your exceptions Who hasn’t been frustrated by the legwork and delays of payment exceptions? Everything from transposed numbers to closed accounts to missing data can strand a payment midstream. Instant connectivity has the potential to alleviate this situation.  In this scenario, instead of sending a batch file for next-day transmission (or printing and mailing checks), imagine technology that can evaluate immediately if payments are complete and accounts are valid—even repairing minor discrepancies automatically. Real-time communications between payment originators, your bank, and other payment endpoints bring this solution to life. 4. Pay non-traditional endpoints Digital wallets bring speed and convenience to consumers, who are adopting them in record numbers. Yet as more companies add branded wallets to their product or service, they’re realizing the right back-office platforms are critical to success.  Rather than adding another vendor to manage, imagine working directly through your bank to establish the real-time connectivity that powers a custom digital wallet experience. One trusted resource could help you design an intuitive workflow, accept new payment methods, and at the same time, enable the necessary back-office functions such as real-time validation, notifications, and reconciliation. 5. Consolidate your reporting When your operations span multiple divisions, countries, currencies, and banks, activities like forecasting and daily cash positioning become arduous. What if, instead of logging into various bank portals, downloading information, and updating complicated spreadsheets, you could find the data you need in a single location?  Consolidated multi-bank real-time reporting is becoming a reality now available, thanks to API connectivity between systems, a push for open banking standards, and comprehensive dashboards. This innovation arms treasury management with sophisticated and up-to-the-minute intelligence across your cash footprint. Staff spend their valuable time evaluating options rather than searching for details.  6. Use your money wisely In rising rate environments, how you manage your liquidity takes on extra significance. But, identifying excess working capital and making smart investment decisions means fast access to data. It’s especially critical for organizations that do business internationally, with cash spread out in accounts worldwide.  APIs and real-time tools can vastly improve your visibility and accelerate your cash flow velocity. Working capital solutions like notional pooling, for example, let you automate and mobilize your excess cash more easily than ever; you can centralize cash management without actually comingling funds or making intercompany loans. Instant access to balances and pending transactions can create other advantages. With real-time solutions, you can make confident decisions in where to spend, where to invest, and how to best use your funds to achieve your business goals.  7. Empower customer service Who hasn’t wondered about the status of an order or when an important payment will arrive? It’s not just a question that finance struggles to answer—employees want to track expense reimbursements; customers and suppliers need accurate data to manage their own balance sheets and update their stakeholders. Real-time access to banking data will be able to supercharge your customer service. Instead of lengthy phone calls or strings of emails, imagine completing payment-related activities directly from your customer-facing mobile app, website, or product. With embedded commerce, you can design the workflow; your bank can supply the data to support your full order-to-cash lifecycle. Make instant data access a priority for treasury Instant access to financial data can accelerate operations, improve decision-making, and increase productivity. It brings benefits that extend far beyond treasury management, to senior leadership, valued customers, and trading partners. There’s no better time than now to talk with your bank about adding real-time capabilities.



Account takeover fraud occurs when a fraudster obtains confidential information – including user IDs, passwords, PINs, and token codes – and uses it to access online banking accounts, transfer funds, or commit other fraudulent acts. Fraudsters gain access by tricking you to divulge your online banking credentials or installing malicious software (malware) on your devices.

If you’re a B2C business, creating a modern billing and payment experience can reach valuable customers and set your company apart. Younger buyers, in particular, consider flexible payment options and convenient digital tools as “table stakes” when choosing their preferred providers.  One-quarter of Millennials, for example, report prioritizing for payment those bills “with the least payment friction.” Another study notes that when given the option, 60 percent of consumers have used a digital wallet (such as  Apple Pay or Google Pay) to pay their bills, attracted by the ability to “pay instantly.” Cash and checks are also in flux as more consumers opt for cards or digital methods. Six in 10 Americans now expect to see a cashless society in their lifetimes. How to stay current with B2C expectations Given all the options, moving your consumer receivables forward can seem overwhelming. Where should you start? Which payment methods should you accept? How can you offer consumers more choices, while at the same time, keep your processing costs and accounts receivable (AR) workload under control? A step-by-step approach will make the process manageable.  Step 1: Make digital-first a priority Before making any changes, look at your customer base and get a better understanding of how and when they want to pay you. Consider also your business model.   Are you a “receipt-only” business where purchase and payment occur simultaneously, such as a coffee shop, an auto repair facility, an online bookstore, or an e-ticketing site?  Or, are you a “receivables” business like a dentist’s office, insurance company, or utility that needs to issue regular invoices, creating a longer and more complicated consumer collection cycle?   Once you know more about your target audience and their payment preferences, you can choose the right electronic payment options. Security and ease of use will be two important criteria so you can make digital payment convenient for consumers, without adding fraud or other risks to your business practices.  Step 2: Streamline your AR workload Adding new billing and payment options is not without its challenges, especially when B2C companies work with numerous payment providers. It can be difficult to create a streamlined and cost-effective solution across many vendors and systems.  As your business invests in electronic billing and payments, involve your bank in an open dialogue about your receivables goals and challenges. Many times, simple changes can make a big impact for AR teams and your bottom line.  For example, if you’re a receivables business that issues customer bills, make sure you’re using digital invoices with a “pay now” button. Your bank can host the electronic payment options of your choice on a secure website that’s branded to your business. A “pay now” feature can significantly increase payment speed and reduce the hassle of accepting checks.  If your customers pay through online bill pay sites, you can optimize your cash flow and increase straight-through processing with a bank-hosted electronic lockbox, or “eBox.” This service aggregates and standardizes all the digital payments you receive through online bill pay sites. Instead of checks and missing information from these third-parties, you receive electronic deposits and consolidated posting files with the account and invoice numbers you need. Step 3: Keep modernizing The consumer payment landscape continues to evolve, as do customer expectations. Fortunately, payment billing and innovations are keeping pace. Savvy B2C businesses are keeping tabs on solutions such as buy now, pay later (BNPL) short-term financing at point-of-sale, faster payment options like the FedNow service, and new ways to integrate mobile devices into the B2C purchase experience. Consumers appear ready to take invoicing and payments by SMS text messaging into the mainstream. They recognize that a text or email reminding them a bill is due makes it easier to pay on time. They also value “pay now” links embedded in reminder messages which make it easier to complete an online payment.   These and other payment innovations give B2C companies a range of ways to satisfy consumers, optimize your cash conversion cycle, and differentiate your business. Your bank can help you navigate the options and choose the solutions that best meet your specific needs.

Helping you streamline online bill payment processing  Initiating bill payments through a single, trusted banking site may be convenient, simple, and paperless for your customers, but the convenience enjoyed by consumers as they schedule their payments online does not always proceed through the Bill Service Provider (BSP) to the Biller. This is due to the fact that many payments, initially submitted online, still end up being mailed out as paper checks by the BSP. These check-only payments create exceptions and often have incomplete or inaccurate remittance details, which can result in further processing delays. The Wells Fargo E-Box® service is a comprehensive solution, enabling you to manage your online remittance process in a consolidated electronic data stream. With flexible multi-step validation and exception handling options, the E-Box service helps you maximize your straight-through electronic processing rate and minimize your exceptions.  Extensive connectivity to major originating endpoints  Wells Fargo connects to all major originating endpoints, including our extensive network of third-party concentrators, to help you maximize your electronic payments.

We’re creating smarter ways for U.S.-based companies and their subsidiaries to manage their global business. With Wells Fargo helping with your international treasury strategy, you’ll have the advantage of one banking relationship that offers both U.S. and in-region implementation and technical support. We can help you strengthen your relationships with your overseas employees, customers, and vendors because you’ll transact with them in currencies that best meet your needs and theirs. Our electronic payment and reporting services are available using one online platform with robust security, our Commercial Electronic Office® (CEO®) portal. You can also use CEO Mobile®, as available in a geographic region, to monitor your accounts, approve transactions, and receive reporting on the go. We offer: Simplified cash management  Manage your Wells Fargo accounts online — CEO connects your offices, operations, and subsidiaries so you can work conveniently and efficiently. Potentially accelerate your cash flow from foreign receivables — make and collect payments in region. Increase visibility into your global cash position — on one single sign-on platform you’ll have end of day and intraday reporting in the same formats for all your Wells Fargo accounts and accounts you hold with other banks.  Easier transactions  Transact throughout the world in multiple currencies — you’ll settle to accounts in those currencies. Where you have receivables that match your required payables currencies, pay your trading partners and others without converting one currency to another — you’ll potentially reduce your foreign exchange cost.  For more resources and insights, read Business Viewpoints.


Our global accounts can help you manage your international operating flows in ways very similar to your day-to-day U.S. treasury activities. You can keep your familiar Wells Fargo banking relationships, customer service, and online access, so that you achieve the simplicity you want. U.S. Foreign Currency Accounts If you’re concerned about foreign exchange risk or the additional due diligence of overseas bank accounts, then a Wells Fargo U.S. Foreign Currency Account may be your best solution. We offer 28 currencies. Because you transact in the account’s currency, you can make outbound wire payments and deposit wire receivables without foreign exchange transaction costs. Because you hold these accounts in the U.S., you no longer need to prepare Foreign Bank Account Reporting (FBAR). Moreover, these accounts are eligible for Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) insurance. How it works  You open an account using a process similar to opening a U.S. demand deposit account. You send wire payments securely cross border from the U.S. using the same channel you use for your U.S. dollar (USD) accounts: CEO® Wires, Foreign Exchange on CEO®, Payment Manager®, or SWIFT services. You receive incoming wire transfers from around the world and incoming book transfers from your other U.S. Wells Fargo accounts. You optionally manage your cash — and cover overdrafts — by establishing a zero or target balance structure so that cash balances move automatically to a parent account.  Accounts for Canada Our in-country international bank accounts in USD and Canadian dollar give you the ability to send and receive electronic payments within Canada and cross border.,  They’re the basis of our Canadian treasury management solutions. Accounts for the U.K., Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA) With choices for British pound (GBP), Euro (EUR), and USD as well as 17 other currencies, a U.K. branch account lets you make non-urgent (Bacs), GBP Faster Payments, and urgent high-value GBP payables and receivables. In addition, approximately 600 partner bank branches throughout the U.K. provide over-the-counter services. You can also initiate and receive same day EUR payments throughout Europe. For non-urgent payments, you can take advantage of the simplified payment format for Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) for both payables and receivables. These accounts are the basis of our EMEA treasury management solutions.


With cross-border and in-country options, you can flexibly make and collect international payments.  Global ACH — With a U.S. USD account, you can send repetitive, non-urgent batch payments (ACH credits) in nine currencies using our Global ACH service. With a U.K. branch account, you can use the same online service to send ACH credits in 11 currencies, so that you can reach more than 40 countries and territories. Beneficiaries receive electronic payments typically within two to five business days. Wire transfers — You can send and receive wires conveniently using the initiation option that suits your needs: online, consolidated payables, SWIFT, or (in the U.S.) application programming interface (API). Payment Manager® — You can streamline your global payments process by sending one file with multiple payment types and related remittance information. This consolidated payables service lets you send files from your internal system. We separate the payments by type and then process them accordingly. By reducing the use of paper documents and manual data entry, you can potentially minimize mistakes and increase efficiency. Foreign Exchange on CEO® — You can send foreign exchange wires 24 hours a day, six days a week online that settle to your commercial accounts. You’ll benefit from live market rates for more than 120 currencies. If you need to generate an audit trail, you can debit a foreign draft with your Wells Fargo USD account and then print it from your location. SWIFT — You can streamline your back office by routing all payments and other transactions to Wells Fargo through SWIFT, a reliable connectivity channel. With request for transfer functionality, you can move money out of non-Wells Fargo accounts, giving you the benefit of concentrating funds.  The following two services help U.S.-based companies receive payments from individuals and entities located outside of the U.S. Global Invoice Connect® Our Global Invoice Connect with TransferMate® service — an inbound payments solution for you — can give your customers in more than 60 countries and territories a convenient electronic payment option in more than 35 currencies. Our service provider provides electronic bill presentment in USD or in your customers’ local currencies and then collects your funds direct to your U.S. USD account. You always receive your full invoiced amount, no matter how your customers pay. Global Check Clearing Through our direct relationships with foreign correspondent banks, combined with high-volume processing, we’re able to offer a cost-effective way to clear checks in a variety of foreign currencies or drawn on foreign banks in eligible countries. Depending on your current method of handling foreign check payments, your funds availability timing may improve.


Our reporting services on CEO® help you can gain insight and control over your global cash picture. Through this secure single sign-on portal, you view details of your pending and posted transactions from a browser on your desktop or mobile device. Additionally, CEO Mobile®, available in select geographic regions, gives you access to reporting on the go. You can alternatively obtain treasury reports by API, Direct BAI, SWIFT, and ISO 20022 channels. Treasury Information Reporting Our Treasury Information Reporting service on CEO delivers previous day composite and intraday composite reports with comprehensive balance, summary, and transaction details. We also provide reporting specific to electronic payment transactions. You can view and download reports for use in your accounting, treasury workstation, enterprise resource planning (ERP), or system of record.

=== Contents of cib-global-services-resources-iban-.txt ===

IBAN stands for International Bank Account Number. It identifies an individual account, at a specific financial institution, in a particular country and is used to process financial transactions between institutions in different countries. Used correctly, the IBAN facilitates faster payment processing. Refer to the IBAN registry (PDF) for a list of countries that require IBANs and each country’s unique IBAN format. SWIFT (Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication) is the official IBAN registrar.



IBAN Format


Using IBAN


SWIFT BIC




The IBAN model creates a standard for account numbering among multiple countries. The model requires certain components to be present in all IBANs, but also allows for some flexibility for country-specific requirements. By adding components to existing account numbers, the IBAN improves a bank’s ability to process cross-border payments without having to manually repair transactions or replace existing account numbers. If you do not use the IBAN in countries that require its use, your payments might be returned without processing. An IBAN consists of up to 34 alphanumeric characters, which include the following:   Country code  – the ISO (International Organization for Standardization) country code   Check digits  – two check digits provided by the issuing financial institution based on a calculation that takes into account the entire IBAN   Bank identifier  – code that identifies the financial institution and, when appropriate, the branch of that financial institution servicing an account   Basic bank account number (BBAN)  – code that identifies an individual account, at a specific financial institution, in a particular country   Sample IBAN Format         Country Code Check Digits Bank Identifier Basic Bank Account Number (BBAN)     GB 76 PNBP 165671 12345678    Refer to the IBAN registry (PDF) for a list of countries that require IBANs and each country’s unique IBAN format.


When preparing your transaction:  Insert the IBAN in the account number field on any forms or screens used to create the payment Do not use both the account number and the IBAN. Remitters sometimes mistakenly insert the account number in the account number field and the IBAN in the bank-to-bank reference field or the OBI (Originating Beneficiary Information) field. Doing so will cause the payment to stop for repair at the beneficiary bank, negating the purpose of the IBAN. Instead, simply place the IBAN, which includes the account number, in the account number field. Include both the beneficiary’s IBAN and SWIFT BIC when making international payments destined for countries that participate in the IBAN registry (see “SWIFT BIC” tab). 


SWIFT BICs (business identifier codes), which are often called SWIFT codes, are a series of either eight or 11 alphanumeric characters that help to identify a specific financial institution. The number includes a bank code, a country code, a location code, and an optional branch code. Sample BIC         Bank Code Country Code Location Code Branch Code     PNBP GB 2L XXX (Represents the head office location)    Including an IBAN and a SWIFT BIC in wire instructions potentially will keep your wire fees lower because financial institutions in the beneficiary’s country may choose to either charge an additional fee for, or return, wires that do not include these numbers. Refer to our international resources for more information on SWIFT BIC numbers and other payment directories. Learn more about SWIFT.

Despite frequent fraud attempts, many businesses do not suffer financial losses because they implement strong fraud protection strategies. Is your organization protected?

Check fraud
Checks continue to be the payment method most often exposed to fraudulent activity. If your company writes checks or maintains checking accounts, we recommend you review the following services to ensure all your checking accounts have the fraud prevention and detection services for your company:  Positive Pay systematically compares checks presented for payment to your issued-check files to detect serial numbers and dollar amounts that don’t match. Payee validation identifies payee names that do not match the payee name information sent on your check issue files. Reverse Positive Pay is an alternative to positive pay services for companies unable to transmit issued-check files to Wells Fargo. You get the opportunity to review checks presented for payment and determine if they should be paid or returned. Payment Authorization enables you to place controls on your accounts that help to prevent fraudulent activity, specifically unauthorized checks and over the counter debits. 


ACH fraud
If you make ACH payments, these services can help protect you:   Wells Fargo ACH Fraud Filter – The "Stop" service automatically stops all ACH debits – except those you specifically pre-authorize – from posting to your accounts. The "Review" service presents transactions to you for pay or return decisions.     Perfect Receivables® service – If your company has a high volume of electronic receivables, reduce the risk that your account number will fall into the wrong hands. The  Perfect Receivables  service protects your account by providing "proxy" account numbers for your customers to use when remitting ACH and wire payments to you.  





Report Fraud
Act fast and follow these important steps immediately if you think you or your company might be the victim of a fraud or attempted fraud.

=== Contents of com-insights-treasury-insights-3-essentials-strengthen-cyber-security-.txt ===

 For CFOs and treasury professionals, sleepless nights are nothing new, especially when it comes to cyber risk management. Sophisticated new threats emerge constantly, each with the potential to disrupt company payments, communications, or operations. Ransomware, denial of service attacks, and business email compromise are just a few of the popular tactics in use today. Establishing a mature cyber security program helps provide robust protection from these and other issues so finance can fulfill its mission. While the information or cyber security teams typically spearhead such an initiative, treasury management can play a critical role.  The strongest cyber security programs align with overall business strategy, creating a unified approach for assessing risk across the business. For treasury, it starts with open dialog to understanding how finance systems, processes, and payments fit into your company’s overall cyber defenses.  Strive for top-down support and cross-functional participation As you dive into cybersecurity, you may hear the phrase “cyber everywhere,” which refers to the ubiquitous nature of cyber threats in today’s complex and digitally connected world. An effective and mature cyber program should encompass a layered security environment of people, processes, and technology. This approach will aggressively and continually mitigate risk and enable you to build capabilities for future protection. Mature cyber security programs focus on security, vigilance, and resilience:  Security — Implementing policies, procedures, and cyber strategies to prevent and detect threats.  Vigilance — Rapidly detecting threats and attacks.  Resilience — Responding and recovering from attacks to restore business operations.  Visible, top-down support is another hallmark. Active involvement by senior leaders emphasizes the importance of cyber security to employees at levels and across all lines of business. Evolve your cyber maturity in these three areas Developing a mature cyber security program means taking a systematic and proactive approach to counteract potential threats. Here are three areas where treasury management can support your company’s efforts and help move your program forward.   Identify and detect threats   When you know the issues most likely to impact your business, it becomes easier to deploy the right protections. A mature cyber security program continually assesses risk factors, then develops processes to monitor and detect potential issues. With today’s interconnected landscape, your lens needs to look beyond internal systems, processes, and people; risk assessments and protections also need to flow through your vendors and supply chain.   Treasury can support your company efforts by sharing knowledge from your bank and payment providers and making sure finance staff understand their role in maintaining a secure environment. Assess organizational readiness   Once you’ve identified potential risks, your company can start to transform systems and processes to better defend your organization. Cross-functional planning sessions and tabletop exercises are two ways to assess your readiness, find gaps, and document resources. Treasury management should be a key participant when exploring any payment-related scenarios.  Respond and recover quickly   The final step toward cyber maturity establishes business continuity plans that indicate how you’ll manage daily operations if a cyber issue does occur. These may include setting up parallel system or processes, identifying critical communications, or testing alternative options with banks, vendors, and other providers. Advance preparation will help you respond and recover quickly.  Continually monitor and improve Just as cyber threats continually evolve, so should your company’s cyber security program. Achieving “maturity” is a continual journey without a clear finish line. However, the more your organization works together to assess and improve, the more resilience your company develops to keep pace with current and future risk factors.

Wedded to spreadsheets and manual data entry? Enjoying the grind of month-end close on day seven? Thrilled at the latest forecast that’s outdated by the time it’s built?  Few treasury professionals would say “yes” to these scenarios. It’s why automation projects are proliferating across finance. There are faster, better ways to work. However, getting corporate stakeholders to invest in treasury projects can be a tough sell. After all, the traditional view holds that accounts payable and receivable are cost centers, not profit-makers.  APIs are game-changers for treasury automation That perception is changing, especially as more businesses realize the competitive advantages that speed, accuracy, and automation can bring. It makes getting your treasury automation project on the corporate To Do list feasible—particularly when you advocate for new solutions that make it faster, easier, and less expensive to update systems, compared to lengthy custom development cycles.  APIs are one of these game-changers.  APIs are prebuilt connections that link company systems (such as an ERP, treasury workstation, mobile app, or payment website) directly to bank products and services, for “always on” exchange of information. Unlike batch processing that happens at set timeframes, or portals and file transfers that require user intervention, APIs move information automatically. The result is instant access to banking information, payments, and other services—without downloading files, waiting for reports, or re-entering data between systems.  How to get traction for your API project To get your API initiative on the radar, along with appropriate funding and IT resources,  build your business case with these three steps.  1. Think big First, start by envisioning what success looks like. Document your current systems and processes, then identify the friction points that impede efficiency, accuracy, or customer service.  Look for opportunities such as:  When do you re-enter data? Where do you use multiple systems to complete an activity? How is the current process impacting staff productivity, corporate decision-making, or customer experience?  This is the time to dream big. Ask for input from a variety of roles, from those who “do” the day-to-day work (such as treasury analysts and frontline accounts payable and receivable clerks) to those who make strategic decisions (such as the head of finance). Involve your bank for perspectives from similar organizations and those outside your industry.  2. Start small Next, prioritize your efforts. Take the big picture opportunities from step one and find small yet high value projects that you can complete quickly and easily, with measurable results. The goal is to show stakeholders the value of automation within a few weeks or months, so you can gain credibility, build traction, and continue funding across multiple budget cycles.  Consider the feasibility of API projects like these:  Automating reconciliation with real-time access to balances and transaction details Streamlining vendor payments with instant confirmation that bank accounts are open and valid Implementing a faster payment method for immediate payment needs, such as contractor reimbursements  Once you’ve narrowed your options, invite your bank and your IT team to the table. Review available APIs and develop requirements specific to your use cases and internal systems.  Most importantly, quantify your projected efficiency gains from automating your treasury processes. Depending on the maturity of your company and your business model, this could include supporting rapid growth without needing to hire new staff, or improving productivity to reallocate existing team members to higher value activities.  3. Learn fast To close your business case, focus on timing. APIs are significantly faster to deploy—and easier to learn and use—compared to buying and training users on new systems, or investing in file transfer capabilities. Work with your project team, IT department, and your bank to find a first project that gets you up-and-running quickly. Demonstrate in your business case how you’ll track improvements, measure ROI, and document future opportunities. Stakeholders will appreciate knowing how you’ll apply your learnings to future endeavors and use their corporate support wisely.  Create momentum beyond a single API project Whether you’re looking to expedite payments, receivables, or reconciliation, or simply to mitigate risk by avoiding manual data entry, the benefits of APIs will be immediate and quantifiable. Using a “think big, start small, learn fast” approach will ensure your automation journey starts strong and maintains momentum for years to come.

The swivel.  If you work in a finance function, you’re familiar with it. It’s the endless movement between multiple screens and applications, “swiveling” back and forth to gather information, manually re-enter data, and complete your daily work.  Finally, the end of the swivel is in sight. Companies of all sizes are automating these routine activities with powerful APIs. They’re accelerating access to information, vastly improving efficiency, and making real-time treasury a reality.  Making real-time treasury possible  Just what is real-time treasury? It’s more than a corporate buzzword; it’s the next horizon for finance. Instead of relying on batch processing and next-day timeframes, real-time treasury delivers data as it happens, directly into company systems. It arms stakeholders with the insights needed for strategic decision-making in real time and simplifies the workload for frontline staff.  APIs are central to achieving real-time treasury. These machine-to-machine interfaces relay information with lightning-fast speeds and with “always on” connectivity. Unlike batch processing that happens at set timeframes, or portals and file transfers that require user intervention, APIs move information automatically.  APIs are not new, but they are seeing mainstream adoption. (Wells Fargo introduced our first APIs and our developer gateway in 2016; we now offer more than 40 proven APIs.)  One of the reasons behind the groundswell—particularly at mid-market companies—is the ease of use that APIs offer. With their “plug and play” functionality, APIs require far less time, effort, and IT resources to implement compared to custom development. They’re equally seamless for users, who find the data they need at their fingertips, without cumbersome swiveling between platforms and portals.  Creating value for staff, customers, and suppliers  APIs bring numerous advantages. Employing these system-to-system connections to your bank can help companies:   Do business more easily. APIs reduce the number of steps and systems it takes to accomplish your goals. Employees can work more productively or redeploy their time to higher value activities compared to downloading files and entering data.  Operate in real-time. Instead of waiting minutes, hours, or even days to obtain transaction data, APIs enable instant, “always on” access to critical information. You can spend more time making decisions and less time hunting for data.  Maximize your investment. Using pre-developed and proven functionality can eliminate weeks and even months from your development cycle. APIs work with most systems that treasury already uses, helping you improve ROI and reduce development costs.  Reduce your risk. APIs deliver up-to-the-minute information, making it possible to settle payments instantly, reconcile transactions daily, and spot fraud attempts quickly. In addition, leveraging APIs from regulated financial institutions safeguards your all-important data by ensuring you integrate with secure and compliant endpoints.  Enhance your customer experience. APIs can help you meet—and exceed—the high expectations that customers, suppliers, and employees bring to their daily activities. The flexibility of APIs and numerous pre-developed options let you identify use cases and create the ideal workflow that meets your needs.   API use cases meet broad range of finance needs  Leading banks offer a range of prebuilt APIs designed to facilitate everything from immediate balance inquiries to transacting faster payments to reconciling in real-time. Ongoing customer feedback and collaboration mean new automation options come to market regularly.  Some of the most popular treasury management APIs include:   Instant visibility into available cash balances  Consolidated multi-bank reporting to streamline cash forecasting  Automated posting to your general ledger or client accounts  Issuing and receiving a variety of faster payments, including Same Day ACH, RTPs, and FedNow   Innovative financial institutions also offer APIs that support broader financial activities. These include solutions for working capital management in the capital markets, and ways for organizations with inventory financing to manage approvals and invoices related to their commercial lines of credit. All benefit from the swift and automated exchange of information.  More options, more automation for treasury The evolution of APIs doesn’t end there. Leading banks are working with ERP providers to develop even smarter API functionality that will deliver the data treasury management needs directly into your system-of-record—without extensive IT resources. These “embedded banking” solutions will maximize convenience and simplify implementation.  APIs offer impressive opportunity for businesses to streamline their banking activities and move real-time treasury from vision to reality. Best of all, they signal an end to the “treasury swivel” and a new way to automate, optimize, and use your team’s talents effectively.

Transcript: Treasury Take: Balancing digital change

[MUSIC UP] Wells Fargo Global Treasury Management Treasury Take A collection of Global Treasury management videos featuring client business leaders sharing knowledge, experience, insights and strategies. What it truly means to digitize your organization Balancing digital changes Adam Rigby  Senior lead Digital Product Manager  Wells Fargo Global Treasury Management Michelle Austin  Chief Financial Officer  Smith Bagley, Inc. Adam Rigby: Digitizing your organization can take a number of different forms. I am Adam Rigby with Wells Fargo and today I have with me Michelle Austin from Smith Bagley, Inc., the Chief Financial Officer, to talk about what her experience has been like digitizing her organization. Michelle, a host of internal and external factors can impact when you make a decision for your organization. Can you talk about what it means to choose between an incremental or transformational change for your business? Michelle Austin: For Smith Bagley, we really haven’t made any transformational changes yet, I think our changes so far have been, you know we’re just getting our feet wet into the digitization and our changes have been minimal. We’ve been able to really offset any costs with some minor changes elsewhere. So, I think, down the road, now that we’re on this path, it’s a great path for us, and I think we’ll be looking for additional changes going forward.  Back to Adam: So, you mentioned costs, can you talk a little about the cost analysis you do when you’re deciding between if I should make a change or stay with the status quo? Back to Michelle: So, within Smith Bagley costs, we don’t have a set aside budget, necessarily, for this digitization in our company. However, what we look at is in terms of efficiencies. So, with the changes, even with the simple ones we’ve made today, we have actually realized some direct cost benefits and time savings benefits. As a small company you know we not able to reduce head count but what we have been able to do is reallocate labor proportionately. Back to Adam: Thank you Michelle, I appreciate you joining us here today. Back to Michelle: You’re very welcome, thanks for having me.

 Criminals thrive on opportunity. They look for weaknesses in systems or processes, then exploit them. When they find a scheme that works, they often deploy it against numerous companies.  Cyber-attacks that follow this pattern appear regularly. Often, threat actors systematically target a specific industry or type of business, wreaking havoc across a single sector. Recent ransomware incidents in the healthcare and services industries such as LockBit offer a prime example.  One way to protect your business is by updating your playbook with a community approach to cyber security.  Expand cyber security beyond your company walls Many businesses have strong internal programs to monitor, detect, and prevent cyber threats. These typically include protocols for company systems, employees, and processes. Communication is also critical. The information security or IT team develops ways to assess risk and share necessary information with company leaders and frontline employee.  Taking cyber security beyond your company walls can arm your business with an additional layer of protection. It may seem counter-intuitive but collaborating with others in your industry or geographic market (and even your competitors) can provide a number of benefits. These advantages include:  Obtaining vital early awareness on new and emerging cyber threats Learning best practices and techniques to improve security Keeping up with new and pending legislation   Invite public and private sector participants Building your community means developing relationships with cyber security professionals outside your company. At first, it may seem strange to work toward a common goal with leaders from other companies. But the more you can find areas of cooperation, the greater the benefit to all involved.  Transparent conversations about what you are seeing or experiencing are key. It also helps to realize that every company will have its own approach to cyber security, and its own tolerance for risk. More sophisticated organizations will likely be more active in monitoring and detecting potential threats, as well as educating others on tactics and best practices.  An effective industry-wide coalition typically includes:  Private sector businesses of all sizes Trade associations Legislative and governing bodies at state and national levels Critical vendors and supply chain resources  Your business still needs an internal cyber security program. However, working together with industry peers helps increase vigilance and resilience for all involved. Industry-wide communication can provide significant muscle to deter threat actors, reduce the impact of cyber-attacks, and decrease risk.

By John Hunter, Head of Global Treasury Management Payments and Transaction Services Wells FargoFor companies large and small, real-time speed and efficiency have arrived. Customers and stakeholders now expect immediate access to information, near-instant transactions, and all from the convenience of their preferred device or system.  Creating the treasury infrastructure to make real-time a reality is more valuable than ever. That’s because back-office functions like cash application, supplier payments, forecasting, and reporting now play a bigger, more vital role in a company’s overall brand and customer experience. It’s why more organizations are working proactively with their bank to develop synergies between their treasury platforms, their payment methods, and their core business functions. Too often, however, technology is the only consideration when companies plan a move from batch processing and legacy tools to the new capabilities available with APIs, webhooks, and other real-time solutions.  It’s just as important to fundamentally evolve your treasury processes, skills, and controls. Only with a shift in perspective will you truly maximize the opportunities that real-time solutions present. Future-proof your business with real-time capabilities Innovative real-time capabilities now span a range of functions, from real-time payments to multi-bank dashboards to automated notifications. It’s an exciting time, with leading banks, fintechs, ERP providers, and other players all unveiling new solutions regularly.  Adopting one or more of these capabilities now (and developing a roadmap for future solutions) helps your organization “future-proof” so you can fully support your customers, internal stakeholders, and key business partners.  Other benefits of real-time treasury solutions include:  Automating routine and redundant activities Attracting and retaining key talent Working efficiently and productively Making stronger business decisions, especially around liquidity Creating a competitive advantage in the market  As your organization crafts its real-time strategy, it’s important to realize the impacts of automation, speed, and visibility to your treasury processes and team. Rethinking the following three elements will set your organization up for success.  1. Rethink your processes Real-time operations dramatically accelerate the speed at which treasury operates. APIs help you replace batch processing, intraday or next-day reporting, and painstaking downloads of data with real-time transactions and instant access to information. Instead of swiveling between numerous platforms, spreadsheets, and portals, you can embed key functionality within your core back-office system—or even your customer-facing applications.  The switch to real-time means rethinking your processes. For example:  What does faster access to information and greater automation mean for staff who apply cash or do cash flow forecasting?  What risk management checkpoints, approvals, and controls need to change in order to safeguard company funds and data in a real-time environment?  How will working capital and liquidity management processes improve? How will your cash application processes change to accommodate real-time payments received on weekends or holidays?  Looking at these and other work flows can help you apply real-time treasury across your customer, supplier, and employee experiences.  2. Rethink your skills Historically, working in finance meant building out spreadsheets, moving data between systems, and even manual activities like printing and mailing customer invoices. Treasury management, accounts receivable, and accounts payable all hired team members versed in these routine tasks.  Now, there’s far more automation. As your organization adopts new solutions, it’s smart to rethink the skillsets you need and how you can redeploy your staff. With current, accurate information at your fingertips, there’s a greater need for those fluent in critical thinking, financial analysis, managing technology, and interpreting data; those who manually process payments, print checks, and reconcile accounts may need upskilling and education for the future.  3. Rethink your technology How your company manages systems is the final area to rethink. Fortunately, APIs and other real-time tools require fewer IT resources and far less investment, compared to custom development efforts of the past. That puts real-time within reach of small and large organizations alike.  It also expands the reach of treasury solutions. Real-time brings treasury beyond the back-office operations and into sales, customer service, and even product development. Rethinking your technology means taking a big picture approach, strengthening relationships across the organization, and working with the right external resources who can bring your business goals to life.  Minimize complexity by working with trusted providers Your bank can play a vital role in your transformation to real-time. You can minimize complexity by working through a few trusted resources rather than sourcing solutions from numerous, disconnected vendors. You can also transact with confidence, especially as more real-time transactions settle with irrevocable terms. It’s vital to safeguard both your data and funds at all points; your financial institution understands and adheres to strict regulations, with powerful fraud-fighting tools. Your bank can even operate as the “connective tissue” that links you to various payment networks, digital wallets, and other innovations that will streamline your workload and power your customer experiences.

Impostor fraud, also known as business email compromise (BEC), occurs when a criminal impersonates someone you know and trust such as a vendor, executive, or the IRS. The impostor contacts you by phone, email, fax, or postal mail and submits an invoice or requests a payment or a change to vendor payment instructions. This results in your payment going to the fraudster rather than where you intended. Unlike other types of fraud, impostor fraud is difficult to detect because the transactions made on your account are consistent with regular payments and are made by authorized personnel. Always verify sensitive requests using this checklist to help ensure you don’t miss an important step. Download checklist (PDF)

Kate Lewis, Accounts Receivable Specialist, started her job at Litehouse Inc. at the right time. Just weeks before, the food manufacturer launched Integrated Receivables (IR) from Wells Fargo. The sophisticated solution quickly transformed the company’s accounts receivable (AR), fully automating 95 percent of their U.S. cash application.  What often took her predecessor a full day, Lewis now handles in 1-2 hours. Gone are cumbersome spreadsheets, manual data entry, and hours spent tracking down details. Wells Fargo’s flexible IR tool applies the power of artificial intelligence and machine learning to expedite the company’s AR processes.  Bringing scale and efficiency to AR Wendy Gibson, Senior Accountant, manages Litehouse’s AR team. After 24 years with the company, working from their Sandpoint, Idaho, headquarters, she recognizes the scale, efficiency, and benefits that automation creates.  In a typical month, IR now automates the processing of more than $21 million in receivables. In a typical month, IR automates an average of 2,000 invoices per month and corresponding check and electronic payments resulting in significant time savings for the Litehouse Inc. team.  “I saw the IR implementation and I was blown away at how fast and easy it was!” Gibson said. “What used to take a person nearly all day—and sometimes into the next day—now can be done in just the morning hours.” Automation is nothing new to Litehouse. Prior to adding IR, they deployed Wells Fargo’s Payment Manager solution to streamline accounts payable (AP). “It works really well,” Gibson explained. “IR is the same concept, bringing in and matching payments automatically. To add receivables and get efficiencies here has been awesome.” Eliminating spreadsheets, manual work, and all-day effort Founded more than 60 years ago, Litehouse has grown from a local institution to a nationwide powerhouse. Their flagship products include a variety of high-quality salad dressings, dips, and salsas found in grocery stores, cafeterias, and restaurant chains around the country.  Processing the invoices and payments associated with a food service business, however, means nuances not found in other industries. With large customers, for example, a single check can cover dozens or even hundreds of open invoices. Customers also routinely apply discounts to their payments, reflecting everything from early payment to products damaged during delivery.  Unraveling those details required patience and hard work for Litehouse. The company uses a specialized ERP for manufacturers. While the system contains fields for discounts and other notes, the AR team could not apply cash directly in the ERP. First, they needed to match payments and open invoices, then balance each day’s cash in an Excel spreadsheet.  “The old way, you had to type everything into a spreadsheet, make sure everything balanced, and it was very cumbersome and time consuming,” Gibson recalled.  She added, “It used to take all day, and sometimes into the next day. We’d all have to pitch in and get caught up.” Automation reduces aging from millions of dollars to under $500,000 Now, only Canadian payments require a spreadsheet, and Litehouse looks forward to automating them with IR in the future.  Gibson and Lewis cite numerous advantages with IR, from reduced Days Sales Outstanding (DSO) and accelerated collections to greater productivity in the AR team.  “A year ago, our aging was very high—and now our 60-day report has shrunk from a few million dollars to under $500,000,” Gibson said. “Part of that is because Kate can get payments in, then move on to collections faster.” Lewis agrees. Her strength is collections; being able to apply each day’s cash quickly gives her ample time to for outreach to customers and other activities that create a positive impact on the bottom line.  “It’s the time factor,” Lewis explained. “If I had to post everything manually, it would take all day. IR gives me time to do other things—specifically collections and some deductions—without needing another person.” Managing growth without adding FTEs Senior management also appreciates the benefits of IR, especially the savings it creates as the company continues to expand. Litehouse Inc. has grown to include five owned brands and a handful of exciting licensing partners, like California Pizza Kitchen. IR has enabled Litehouse’s small AR team—just four specialists for invoicing, deductions, cash application, and collections—to keep up with the pace and they now have more capacity for other core activities.   “We’re just growing out of sight, but Integrated Receivables has helped us scale our business without needing to hire more  headcount,” Gibson said. “We would have needed another person to do collections if we kept working manually.” Gibson’s pride in their accomplishments comes from being not just the manager of AR, but a stakeholder in Litehouse’s future. The organization is 100% employee-owned, sharing values of integrity, stewardship, accountability, and excellence. Using IR helps them achieve these goals.  She encourages other organizations to make the switch to IR. Her advice?  “I’d tell them get with this century! We’re all looking for new efficiencies, and this is the way to go,” Gibson said. Lewis concurred, adding, “Integrated Receivables makes the process so time efficient—it really has been amazing.”

 FDA approval is a foundational requirement for many products developed by pharmaceutical and other healthcare startups, however a lot more preparation is required for commercial success. To create financial value, it is important that Pharma and Health Tech companies execute a well-orchestrated go-to-market strategy. Unfortunately, many companies, large and small, fail in this process due to both poor preparation and misjudging the complexities of scaling an organization quickly enough to seize the opportunities created by a successful product. Evolving Challenges since COVID-19  It is estimated that at least 90% of all startups fail which is representative of the healthcare market as well: 90% of startups in the healthcare market will fail or be “aqui-hired” (acquiring a company’s talent) within 2-5 years of launching. For Healthcare and Pharma startups, the product itself is rarely the problem: Failure is often the result of an unclear business model, the lack of a clear go-to-market strategy, or a poorly defined value proposition. During the COVID-19 pandemic, many investors looked to the public health and infectious disease space as the next big opportunity, but the obstacles facing these startups were even greater than in other sectors. Not surprisingly, the main challenges which startups usually face include finding customers and securing the investments needed for their innovations. During the pandemic when compared with pre-pandemic data, these challenges increased by 20% and 8% respectively. Post the COVID-19 pandemic, new capital has become increasingly harder to access and even more expensive due to increased risk in a volatile rate environment. While funding is still available, it has become more competitive than ever to gain investors' trust and investments. Venture Capital funds have begun looking more closely at underlying business models, growth strategies, and how successful products will be when launched at scale. Business Planning and Quality Control While influence in the industry and comprehensive business planning can increase the odds of commercial success, there are many circumstances out of our start-up clients’ control, including: the timing of an FDA approval, potential changes in regulation which might not get past the comment period or may require multiple iterations, delays in the next funding rounds, etc. Despite these points of uncertainty, a company can control the quality and efficacy of its business processes and controls, in addition to how it poises itself for success within its specialty. Investors are just as much interested in the efficacy of the product as the foundation and direction of the organization overall. Especially the finance and treasury function can use the time before the FDA approval to get business processes in order and look for opportunities to build out scalable processes. Examples of foundations which should be set early on include Finance and Treasury functions; taking advantage of the timeframe prior to FDA approval will allow a smooth implementation of business processes, thereby allowing for more opportunities to build out scalable processes. Cash flow is another particular financial measure to keep an eye on during periods of growth, especially in circumstances where additional venture funding is slower than in previous years, so paying careful attention to timing of cash flow will pay off now and in the future. By being attentive at the key moments to Treasury and Finance metrics, the growth trajectory of a startup can increase sustainably, keeping the interest of investors. Key infrastructure components which will need to be reviewed and put in place are the ERP system, HR platform, and digital payments ecosystem. Let’s look at each one in more detail and highlight how these relate to the high growth enablement. HR, ERP, and Electronic Payments  The implementation of an HR system to automate the HR related processes and functions of a startup are significant, and can occur either on a standalone basis, or an integrated one within the ERP. When set-up correctly, many HR related functions can be automated such as recruiting and training new employees, hiring, benefits administration, performance management, payroll, and tracking of compliance requirements. Especially in times of accelerated hiring and onboarding of new employees, the HR system needs to be scalable and compliant with the applicable state and federal regulations. ERP and HR applications are held to high cyber security standards are paramount in protecting proprietary and patient data for your startup. Many hosted and cloud-based solutions of HR and ERP systems support pay-as-you go models which reduce the need for an upfront investment and leave the operations of the systems and certain cyber security matters to third party providers. The third component involves setting up electronic payments and receivables processes that integrate with the aforementioned ERP and HR system. To ensure scalability, manual and paper-based processes should be avoided for these responsibilities. Electronic bank statements and commercial card files should be inputted into the ERP automatically to support auto reconciliation and identify exceptions, both of which would identify fraud quickly. If travel is a major requirement, a commercial travel card program will need to be established early on and will also need to support controls that align with policies and avoid sales practice issues. Pricing and Billing Models It is also important to think about different pricing and billing models early on which will need to be supported as part of the go-to-market strategy. Flexibility of the billing platform and integration into the Account Receivables process will be important in reducing lost revenue and in avoiding granting unwarranted discounts. Once a new product is on the market questions arise such as:    How will orders be created? What payment terms will be offered to different distributors of the product and how will adherence be tracked Is a sales force or regional representation required to promote the new product across the US or even internationally? Will discounts be provided for certain markets?  Once actual sales start taking place, a key metric which should be tracked is days receivables outstanding or DSO which measures the time it takes to collect receivables once invoices are issued. The first step in taking control of DSO starts by automating the invoicing and collection process and consider solutions that match incoming payments to remittance data automatically. To optimize DSO further, receivables financing solutions can also be reviewed, thus releasing cash as well as managing the risk on the companies’ balance sheet. On the payable side, the goal is to optimize the days payables outstanding (DPO). When the pay is too slow, discount may be missed, and when pay is too quick, there may be impact to the available cash. One option to extend payment timelines without jeopardizing supplier relationships can be the use of virtual cards to give suppliers immediate payment while the company retains its working capital up to 30 days. Data Protection and Privacy In addition to technology and reliable data, a scalable business will require policies and controls that need to be established and documented early in the lifecycle of the company.  Controls need to be enforced and their effectiveness will depend on the data quality and by the business workflows which the ERP and HR systems enforce consistently across the organization. In addition to good clinical practice (GCP), product safety and manufacturing policies, other policies, and controls to consider are:  Data protection and privacy policy governs how sensitive information such as personal data and confidential business information will be protected Information security policy outlines how information systems, networks, and data will be protected from unauthorized access, theft, and cyberattacks and what to do in case of a breach Compliance policy specifies the company's compliance with relevant laws and regulations including DA, EMA, and other regulatory agencies. Investment Policy governs investment objectives, asset allocation, risk tolerance, diversification and any restrictions Data Quality Policy sets procedures for ensuring the accuracy, completeness, and reliability of data across the organization HR policies covers Recruitment and hiring, Compensation and Benefits, Time Off and Leaves of Absence, and Health and Safety Accounting and Finance policies governs financial reporting, internal controls, revenue recognition, accounts receivable, accounts payable, cash management, budgeting, and tax planning  Well documented policies and controls, combined with the right technology will not only enable the company to grow its operation to scale quickly but also to confidently establish SOX reporting that can hold up to the scrutiny of external auditors, and also prepare the organization for their public filings when the time comes. Significance of Data in Securing Capital According to Deloitte, “…products and solutions that address well-being and care delivery, along with open, secure data and interoperable platforms, are likely to continue receiving the lion’s share of funding”. In addition to providing capital, investors and strategic partners should assume a consultative role, and bring their industry and regulatory experience to innovative startups. Advancing with technology and automation, enforcing policies and controls, establishing a unique value proposition, and most importantly, having a clear business model will all determine the success of a healthcare startup. When partnered with the best investors and consultants for them, innovators can continue to grow, improve quality of care, and deliver value to patients for a better future in healthcare. Investing in the readiness many months or years before the formal authorization is received by the FDA might not be intuitive but lacking the capabilities and functions will lead to performance challenges or avoidable risk exposures that can hurt the future success of the company. Creating the above-mentioned functions on the fly seldomly work and unreliable financial data will most certainly impact obtaining further funding, a public offering or sale of the company. To be successful, a company needs to find common ground with investors, customers, health care providers, patients, and potential acquirers early and often. Stakeholder input is needed early to avoid mistakes that can impede any chance of a success a company may have later down the road. Health care companies are required to amass specific evidence and data to achieve key milestones such as raising capital, regulatory clearance or approval, and obtaining insurance reimbursement or payment. A common mistake is thinking about evidence generation in a linear manner and focusing just on what is needed for the next milestone. This is a common and costly error that can significantly delay time to success. Far too many startups succeed in achieving a regulatory milestone but then run out of funding before generating sufficient evidence to convince customers to buy their products so effective budget planning and allocating is key when it comes to evidence generation. To avoid errors such as this, start conversations early with all relevant stakeholders about what data they will require. Also consider the Food and Drug Administration’s innovative Payor Communication Task Force; this task force involves public and private payers such as Medicare and Medicaid, private health plans, health technology assessment groups, and others in the pre-submission process in conjunction with a parallel review with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to potentially shorten the time between FDA approval and coverage decisions. It’s essential to know who will be paying for your products and how the reimbursement will work. Misunderstanding the complicated and ever-changing economics of payment reimbursements is a costly, and easy one to make. Many health care startups develop a strategy that will let them sell straight to consumers, thinking that it would be a simpler model. They assume this way they are able to skip the time and expense consuming regulatory approval. Angel investors with small pockets tend to favor this strategy. The problem is that this relies on the often-flawed assumption that consumers are willing to pay out of pocket for health-related products and services. Excluding the outliers who are early adopters of the out-of-pocket payments, most consumers naturally want their health plans to pay. As a result, consumer health startups often wind-up pivoting strategies in order to pursue a regulated device strategy, but many run out of the necessary funds before they get there. Making an informed decision on payments strategy early on will help to determine whether your startup will perform better by offering its innovations as regulated or as non-regulated products. Know Your Customers and all indications for your innovations We regularly see startups whose technology has multiple potential indications however they typically choose the initial indication based on the one the company founder knows the most about — a founder who is a liver cancer surgeon, for example, choosing liver cancer over breast cancer. This type of decision making isn’t always the right call, and the evidence generated in an incorrect initial indication can drain resources before you even have the chance to pivot. To arrive at the best indication, complete a value proposition analysis on all indications and choose the one which is the most compelling in terms of market size, competitive landscape, and patient adoption. These qualifiers should help inform the decision on which indication to initially prioritize and pursue. After arriving at this stage, you may think your technology will be adopted because of the potential for improved patient outcomes or lowering overall costs, but if it adds steps or changes a procedure for the ones who are administering your product or service, you are not just disrupting an industry, but the key stakeholders and decision makers. To have the greatest chance at success, the innovative health technology should integrate as seamlessly as possible into existing workflows, not delay, or interrupt them. Therefore, it’s essential to take ownership of knowing the details of every step and aspect of a customer’s workflow including every person who will be affected by it, because one weak link in the new process can potentially prevent your innovation from being adopted. For example, a surgeon may love your technology, but if it impacts a Nurse’s or Technician’s shift workload then an adoption hurdle will loom. Simulating conduct discovery, focus groups, and user testing with every key player in the actual impacted workflow in as many situations as possible can help clarify any pain points or inefficiencies before they become an obstacle in a live environment. Being mindful of the learning points outlined in this white paper should give you a clear starting point of which pain points in your growth you may anticipate and can tackle ahead of time with your business advisory team. Staying proactive in your business strategy at every stage, maintaining a strong brand vision, offering scalable products and services adaptable to serve multiple customer types are paramount for any healthcare startup. What is even more beneficial in addition to what all strong startups have is ensuring that all key stakeholders in your company structure have a comprehensive understanding of all payment and reimbursement dynamic options which are usually moving targets. Wells Fargo is here to help support all aspects of your startup through this exciting, innovative journey and will help you make your mark on the future of positive global healthcare outcomes. Your relationship manager will be pleased to provide more information on Wells Fargo’s financial strategies for the healthcare industry and other correspondent services.

Historically, automating tasks involved removing the people from processes. Today, digital transformation considers the human factor to be essential to systems design. Nowhere is this more vital than in fighting fraud. Key to success requires understanding the relationship between people and technology and developing systems and processes to enable people to supervise automated tasks. When automation alienates  While automation can streamline and simplify, it also often changes the tasks at hand. What was routine for employees can become unfamiliar or even more complex. For example, file encryption can add new steps. Shifting from in-person to online meetings introduces new processes. Technology typically changes how people fit into their environment, and this can be disruptive.  Trust but verify When it comes to fraud detection, every second counts. Technology is a key tool in fast detection. However, sometimes we blindly trust technology. If something doesn’t look right, we may overly rely on what machines tell us is happening while ignoring our common sense.   It’s important to trust but verify your technology. Human intuition is a key skill in early fraud detection and in critical thinking that can help to prevent fraud.   When introducing automation to fight fraud, the human element becomes more, not less important. People must remain a critical part of digital transformation. Even companies that invest in artificial intelligence should not lose sight of the value of human intelligence. Add sensemaking to your fraud detection arsenal Intuitive skills can help us to understand connections between information, circumstances, and our actions so that we can recognize situations, detect problems, and understand how to adapt and respond. This cognitive process is known as sensemaking.  If you are increasing your reliance on automation to detect fraud, human sensemaking becomes an important counterbalance. If you can’t afford to invest in technology, and your people remain your only front-line fraud defense, sensemaking is a particularly valuable skill.  Train employee intuition Making sense takes common sense. However, intuition can be an especially powerful resource when trained. How do you train your people in sensemaking?  Allow employees to trust but verify technology as part of their daily routine. Develop procedures and protocols that support this approach, and train people to follow them. Put checks and balances in place, such as reviewing key reports regularly. Build controls into your technology.  For example, include a human override or kill switch that pauses an automated process from advancing without approval. Cultivate employees not only as sensers but as innovators. It’s important to rely on employees not only to sense when something is wrong but to suggest better procedures. Establish a culture where employees feel comfortable to speak up when they find a better way of doing things, not only for detecting fraud but for preventing it. Training and educational opportunities support this kind of environment.  People are a key factor in fraud detection. Digital transformation aimed at fighting fraud should be designed with human oversight in mind. As part of this, it’s important to cultivate the ability for employees to sense when something is not right and to act accordingly.

With sales and other functions curtailed, payments are crucial to business viability, now may be the time to enhance your accounts receivable and payable by implementing the following strategies. Refine accounts receivable Move to electronic receivables. Checks require people to be physically present to handle them. If you’ve been meaning to move to electronic payments for efficiency reasons, this is a good reason to do it now. Talk to customers about paying you by ACH, RTP, or online, and redesign invoices to show your preferred payment methods. Talk to your bank about setting up electronic receivables services. Post unapplied payments. You want customers to buy from you again, and soon. Open their receivable accounts by researching and posting unapplied payments. Update your receivables accounts. Remove inactive accounts and duplicates. A clean list may help make processing payments faster and easier and help avoid exceptions. Review past-due accounts. Connecting with your customers is important. If they can’t pay the full amount, perhaps offer discounts or set up payment plans. You may want to add or assign resources to help bring in needed cash. Hone accounts payable Make more payments electronically. If you’re having trouble printing checks, your customers are having trouble receiving them. Offer electronic payment options such as ACH, RTP, and commercial card. Reach out to suppliers. If you have invoices that are difficult to process, tell your suppliers how they may help make your invoice processing easier. It may be as simple as including the P.O. number or invoice number on their bills. Clean up master vendor files. Vendor contact names, phone numbers, addresses, and terms keep changing. To help avoid duplicate payments and business email compromise (BEC) fraud, validate the information on file, remove duplicates, and archive inactive vendors. Handle uncashed checks. No one wants checks to go into escheatment. If you have checks uncashed past their stale dates, try to contact payees to learn why they haven’t been cashed. Moving away from check payments to electronic payments can lessen the likelihood of creating unclaimed property. Prepare for exigencies to come After Superstorm Sandy, the Great Recession, COVID-19, and more, who knows what’s coming next. Increase your preparedness with these BCP measures. Write or update standard operating procedures (SOPS). When you have turnover or absenteeism, structured process management will enable business as usual. Cross-train employees. Build bench strength so jobs will get done when the usual team members are unavailable. Conduct fraud training. Businesses are more vulnerable to fraud in times of turmoil. Increase fraud awareness – especially awareness of business email compromise fraud – through video conferencing or meetings. As you implement these best practices, you may gain insights into where and how you might improve your processes. Insights you can put into action when normalcy returns.

 As businesses navigate the current economic landscape, their treasurers are facing an increasingly complex and volatile environment. Two key areas of concern are the implications of high interest rates and supply chain risks. These factors can impact a company's liquidity position and working capital, making effective management of these areas of critical importance. High Interest Rates Interest rates are a crucial component of the financial system, influencing borrowing costs, savings rates, and investment returns. When interest rates rise, there are implications for treasurers, with two primary ways that high-interest rates can impact a business’s finances.  Firstly, the cost of refinancing debt increases. As interest rates rise, the cost of borrowing for companies also goes up. With 78.8% of investment-grade U.S. corporate debt maturing this year, the impact of higher borrowing costs for companies to refinance their debt can impact their cash flows and profitability. Treasurers need to assess the implications of rising interest rates on their organization’s debt servicing costs and develop strategies to mitigate the impact. At times like this, access to excess cash reserves and optimizing receivables management become paramount. Secondly, treasurers need to re-evaluate their hedging strategies. These could be both on and off-balance sheet. The more obvious hedges companies can take advantage of are where companies enter derivative hedging contracts to manage interest rate risk. When interest rates increase, the value of these contracts may change triggering calls on cash. There also remain the need for hedging embedded risks in a company’s supply chain. Supply Chain Risks The pandemic has disrupted global supply chains, increasing the focus on diversifying the supplier base and near-shoring production centers. However, these strategies also come with their own set of potential risks, such as increased freight costs, fewer discounts due to lower individual purchase orders and foreign exchange risk. Adding to this could be the differing approaches by central banks in their response to inflation and subsequent rate hikes which have increased volatility in the foreign exchange markets. All of this could trigger re-pricing clauses in supply contracts, increasing the demand for cash to fund payables. Managing Liquidity Positions and Working Capital Given the uncertainties in the current economic environment, treasurers should adopt a proactive approach to managing their liquidity positions and working capital. Some strategies that treasurers could use to manage their liquidity positions and working capital effectively include: 1. Improve visibility on cash flows and off-balance sheet liabilities Treasurers should have a clear understanding of their cash flow requirements and develop robust cash flow forecasting models to manage their liquidity positions effectively. Treasurers should work closely with the business development and procurement teams to advise them on the re-pricing risks embedded in supply contracts and to thereafter include these contingent liabilities into their cash flow projections. These should be considered when procurement might not be able to lock in pricing for future deliveries creating uncertainty for cash outflows and their timing. 2. Optimize working capital across the supply chain Treasurers should work closely with their procurement and supply chain teams to optimize their working capital, as they could potentially reduce the amount of cash tied up in inventory and accounts receivable and have plans ready to extend payables if required. 3. Work closely with suppliers Given the supply chain risks, treasurers may work closely with suppliers through their procurement teams to ensure they are meeting their contractual obligations and to develop contingency plans in case of disruptions and shipping delays even as their companies execute plans to diversify their supplier base. 4. Consider alternative financing options Treasurers could consider alternative financing options, such as factoring or supply chain finance, to improve their liquidity positions. Smaller companies could benefit from supplier financing if the supplier has lower financing costs. For smaller ticket items, corporate purchase card programs could be considered. 5. Work closely with their bank Treasurers should review their bank’s capital, short term liquidity metrics, and discuss their lending capacity. Treasurers should ensure that their bank is aware of any refinancing or new financing plans. Conclusion The current economic environment is characterized by high interest rates and supply chain risks, making it critical for treasurers to manage their liquidity positions and working capital effectively. By focusing on cash flow forecasting, optimizing working capital, refocusing on supply chain risks, and considering alternative financing options, treasurers can mitigate the impact of these risks on their working capital in an effort to ensure that their organizations remain financially stable.

With rates rising and the cost of funds increasing, there’s a new sense of urgency for companies to improve efficiency, reduce expenses, and maximize liquidity. Centralizing some or all treasury management functions, such as cash management, helps achieve this goal.  Transforming treasury operations is not a new concept. However, it’s become more critical as treasury management’s role in the organization grows more strategic.  A centralized treasury structure provides greater visibility, improves control, and automates and streamlines processes. It arms senior leaders with the information and systems needed to make insightful decisions and act quickly. Centralizing cash management yields many benefits Cash management is one of the best places to centralize because the benefits will be immediate and tangible. It enables you to access your daily cash position quickly and easily, then make strategic decisions about excess funds and idle cash with speed and agility.  Numerous other benefits are possible with a centralized structure. Treasury can take advantage of:  Standard processes, controls, and metrics across the entire organization that streamline daily work, reduce risk, and improve treasury’s line of sight.  A single entity managing risk, which simplifies counterparty relationships and lets global organizations take greater advantage of natural hedging for foreign exchange (FX). Stronger working capital and liquidity management which can minimize external borrowing requirements and increase return on equity (ROE). Increased operational efficiencies, made possible with fewer bank accounts to manage, optimal FTE staffing, and for more sophisticated companies, shared service centers for payables, receivables, and other transactions.  Move toward centralization with these fundamental first steps Moving away from a decentralized structure can seem overwhelming. But, like many journeys, the hardest part is often figuring out where to begin.  First, establish your company’s long-term vision for centralization. Use your bank as a resource at this stage—they can help you compare options, share best practices, and provide insight into how similar companies handle their cash management and liquidity. Next, identify discrete short-term projects that are manageable in scope and can deliver measurable results. Consider these key elements: Get buy-in from stakeholders. No strategic project works well without top-down support. Enlist C-suite and line of business leaders for sponsorship and input, then keep them up-to-date on progress and early wins. Rationalize your bank accounts. Start with an inventory of banks and accounts across the organization. Identify the type and purpose of each, along with ownership and signatory capabilities. Look at currencies as well. This exercise will help you standardize across entities, ensure the right controls are in place, and as needed, consolidate for more efficient banking relationships and liquidity management.  Evaluate local versus central control. Centralizing cash management and other treasury management functions doesn’t have to be “all or nothing.” Hybrid options can give ownership to local entities while simultaneously automating processes, strengthening oversight, and improving cash management. Work with your bank to understand your options, then match strategies to your desired level of control.  Review technology options. In the past, centralizing meant arduous IT integrations and lengthy timeframes. Today, even in-house banks require very little IT effort, thanks to cloud-based solutions, real-time connectivity with APIs, and automated ledger entries. Achieving your goals may be faster and more cost-effective than you think, with banks, fintechs, and ERP providers all delivering “plug and play” solutions.  Take advantage of early wins Just as the journey image implies, change and centralization won’t happen overnight. But, every decision that standardizes a process, automates a workflow, or centralizes access to cash will help treasury operate more effectively. Set appropriate expectations with stakeholders, then work with your bank to find early wins you can measure, celebrate, and build from.


=== Contents of com-insights-treasury-insights-rtp-fednow-comprehensive-instant-payment-strategy-.txt ===

First, there were electronic transactions with next business day settlement. Then faster payments arrived, revolutionizing how companies and consumers move money. Now, two instant payment methods push speed and availability even faster: RTP® from The Clearing House® and the upcoming FedNowSM service.  Both platforms can help companies reach domestic DDA accountholders 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year, with irrevocable transactions. RTPs allow payments up to $1 million; FedNow will launch with a $500,000 per-transaction limit.  With so many choices in the market, many treasury professionals are asking, should we deploy RTP now? Or wait until 2023 and adopt FedNow? Which method is best for our disbursement needs? Instead of taking a “wait and see” approach, there’s good reason for businesses to consult with their banks now to make sure you’re maximizing the opportunity presented by instant payment methods. Savvy financial institutions are working side-by-side with payment providers and customers to make using these new methods as seamless as possible.  Gain a competitive advantage with instant payments Instant payment rails like RTP and FedNow empower businesses to send and receive payments within seconds, giving payees almost immediate access to the funds.  This speed and control provides a number of potential benefits: Stronger liquidity management. Instant payments can reduce uncertainty from payment delays and boost working capital, helping businesses strengthen liquidity management and reduce the need for excess cash on hand to cover emergencies or float. Greater customer and supplier satisfaction. No matter who your business pays, reducing the time and effort it takes to receive funds makes a difference. Paying time-sensitive contracts or insurance claims with instant transaction capabilities, for example, can improve your brand experience and even be a competitive differentiator.  Reduced friction across the payment process. Instant payments not only settle faster, they also make invoicing, deposits, posting, and other accounting activities easier. Unlike checks or other payment types, there’s less need for data entry or research to apply payments. “Request for payment” functionality can even eliminate invoicing. Use instant payments when speed, accuracy, and finality matter How will you know which instant payment methods are right for your organization? Start by considering your use cases. Instant payments like FedNow and RTP work best when speed, accuracy, and finality are critical to the transaction.  Early adopters use instant payments for scenarios like these:  Mortgage and lending payoffs at closing Insurance claims settlements to policyholders Emergency payroll and gig employee payouts for the company workforce Merger and acquisition transactions Time-sensitive payments to key suppliers  Next, work with your bank to understand the requirements for issuing instant payments via The Clearing House and the Federal Reserve. Connectivity will be important, as these transactions may require an alternative to daily batch processing.  Payee preference is another factor. Providing your suppliers and customers with options for instant payment can lead to greater satisfaction with your organization. Look for bank tools that help you with payment “decisioning” so you can serve your payees well, without adding extra workload for your team. An instant payments engine lets you send transaction details, while your bank helps manage the process of routing each disbursement through the best instant payments network for your business need.  Lastly, consider the impacts of non-refutable transactions. How will you update your internal treasury management policies and controls, and set appropriate permissions and limits in your systems, so you’re assured your payments reach the correct recipients? Leveraging dual controls, account validation, and other services will help everyone in your company transact with confidence.  Modernize your payments experience In the blink of an eye, it’s now possible to move money safely, efficiently, and conveniently. RTPs and FedNow help your business enjoy these benefits and stay current with the latest instant payment options.

[MUSIC UP]  Wells Fargo Global Treasury Management  Treasury Take  A collection of Global Treasury management videos featuring client business leaders sharing knowledge, experience, insights and strategies.  What it truly means to digitize your organization  The path to digitization  Adam Rigby  Senior lead Digital Product Manager  Wells Fargo Global Treasury Management  Michelle Austin  Chief Financial Officer  Smith Bagley, Inc.  Adam Rigby: Digitizing your organization can take a number of different forms. I am Adam Rigby with Wells Fargo and today I have with me Michelle Austin from Smith Bagley, Inc, the Chief Financial Officer, to talk about what her experience has been like digitizing her organization. Can you talk a little bit about where you are in your company's journey today?  Michelle Austin: Yes, at Smith Bagley, back in 2020, during the pandemic we realized that we really needed a solution to pay our vendors remotely. And so, in 2021 looked and met with a number of different solutions and in 2022 actually implemented a consolidated file process. What that does for us is allows us, our staff, to be 100% remote. We basically take an open payables file and transform that through some help from our MIS department. And that then is uploaded in into the file portal and from there all the payments are done by a third-party vendor. So, it’s been a great solution for us. It’s allowed us, like I said, some efficiencies, in addition to doing something that doesn’t matter if we have staff in the office or not.  Back to Adam: Can you talk a little bit about what it means for your AP team in terms of efficiency because you’ve implemented that change?  Back to Michelle: It’s been great, so our team can work, like I said, 100% remote. I don’t have to worry about having people in the office to get the check stock, sign the checks, stuff the checks, put them in the mail. Saved us some direct costs obviously for all the same reasons, and it’s allowed us really to repurpose that labor. So, we’ve got staff today that used to spend their time doing the very manual tasks that I just described and now they can focus on more important things.  Back to Adam: Thank you Michelle, I appreciate you joining us here today.  Back to Michelle: You’re very welcome.

Michelle is going to talk to us a little bit about what it’s been like at her organization to digitize her business. Michelle, as you’ve been evaluating traditional processes vs digitization options. What have you been weighing in as the pros and cons for the alternatives?  Michelle Austin: Well, what I would like to see for our organization is ultimately, we would have a system for the accounts payable side where we have our invoices come in electronically. We have them processed and sent out remotely to the approvers, and then they come back into our AP system, and that would all be done through AI.  On the receivables side, a similar process where we can do reconciliations electronically and then consolidation of our payment streams.  We receive a number of payments from our customers through various forms and so looking for a way to consolidate all of that through AI on the backend as well, that would be great.  Obviously, the technology has to be balanced with the cost.

=== Contents of com-insights-treasury-insights-treasury-evolving-real-time--.txt ===

By John Hunter, Head of Global Treasury Management Payments and Transaction Services Wells Fargo   The era of “real time” has arrived. Speed has changed our lives dramatically compared to just a few years ago, impacting everything from sending and receiving funds in an instant, to streaming live content, to checking the status of your order with a simple click. “Now” is the new normal; waiting is no longer an option.   Yet in many finance departments it’s still business as usual. Payments, reporting, and liquidity management all rely on the same day-old (or older) data, the same batch processing and manual operations that were “leading edge” more than a decade ago.  Setting a new standard for cash management  If your treasury seems trapped in the past, it’s definitely time to move forward. Instant access to data can revolutionize your company’s financial operations, as well as your customer, supplier, and employee experiences. Considering your options now, as well as involving your bank in planning will ensure you keep pace with the latest developments as they become available.  Innovations in technology make real-time enhancements possible, leveling the playing field for smaller organizations. In the past, only large and sophisticated companies could invest in custom ERP upgrades and system-to-system connectivity. Now, real-time tools like APIs and webhooks, greater adoption of industry standards, and the leadership of key banks are all helping to simplify and democratize real-time access.  New solutions will be scalable for small and medium-sized businesses as well as global enterprises. The result is a new standard for real-time cash management.  7 ways to accelerate progress  Consider opportunities like these for treasury management to put real-time connectivity into practical application.   Imagine making liquidity decisions and mobilizing your cash based on up-to-the-minute balances pulled from accounts at multiple banks. Imagine simplifying your transactions, so each payment uses the method that’s fastest, safest, and most cost-effective.  Imagine making customer service a great experience with automatic notifications and real-time transaction status, all from within your product or mobile app.   There’s even more potential on the horizon as banks and fintechs continue innovating. We’re excited about these seven scenarios: 1. Route your payments efficiently The options for sending and receiving transactions continue to grow, adding complexity and at times, cost. When you have a handful of critical payments, it’s feasible to research the most efficient method (such as wires, Same Day ACH, RTP, or the new FedNow network). But scaling those decisions for larger payment volumes requires substantial information, processing power, and automation.  Enter intelligent routing. With a solution like this, you and your bank will create business rules specific to your priorities, whether you need speed of settlement, lowest processing cost, international reach, or other capabilities. Then, your bank’s payment platform will deploy the best transaction method. The delivery industry already employs this type of tool with great success, letting smart technology recommend the best carrier and delivery timeframe for shipments – so why not do the same with your payments.  2. Detect fraud attempts instantly What if instant access to data could better protect your funds? Your bank, your fraud protection services, and the payment networks you use already collect and monitor thousands of datapoints in real-time. Imagine accessing this sophisticated intelligence to spot potential fraud and misuse before a payment occurs. Real-time connectivity can power this type of solution in the near future. For example, if you’ve never before made a payment in Asia, or if your standard transaction is $5,000 not $50,000, a real-time fraud protection service could detect anomalies and notify your team before you issue the payment. With more irrevocable transactions and real-time settlement, it will be an important safeguard to put on your treasury “must have” list.  3. Reduce your exceptions Who hasn’t been frustrated by the legwork and delays of payment exceptions? Everything from transposed numbers to closed accounts to missing data can strand a payment midstream. Instant connectivity has the potential to alleviate this situation.  In this scenario, instead of sending a batch file for next-day transmission (or printing and mailing checks), imagine technology that can evaluate immediately if payments are complete and accounts are valid—even repairing minor discrepancies automatically. Real-time communications between payment originators, your bank, and other payment endpoints bring this solution to life. 4. Pay non-traditional endpoints Digital wallets bring speed and convenience to consumers, who are adopting them in record numbers. Yet as more companies add branded wallets to their product or service, they’re realizing the right back-office platforms are critical to success.  Rather than adding another vendor to manage, imagine working directly through your bank to establish the real-time connectivity that powers a custom digital wallet experience. One trusted resource could help you design an intuitive workflow, accept new payment methods, and at the same time, enable the necessary back-office functions such as real-time validation, notifications, and reconciliation. 5. Consolidate your reporting When your operations span multiple divisions, countries, currencies, and banks, activities like forecasting and daily cash positioning become arduous. What if, instead of logging into various bank portals, downloading information, and updating complicated spreadsheets, you could find the data you need in a single location?  Consolidated multi-bank real-time reporting is becoming a reality now available, thanks to API connectivity between systems, a push for open banking standards, and comprehensive dashboards. This innovation arms treasury management with sophisticated and up-to-the-minute intelligence across your cash footprint. Staff spend their valuable time evaluating options rather than searching for details.  6. Use your money wisely In rising rate environments, how you manage your liquidity takes on extra significance. But, identifying excess working capital and making smart investment decisions means fast access to data. It’s especially critical for organizations that do business internationally, with cash spread out in accounts worldwide.  APIs and real-time tools can vastly improve your visibility and accelerate your cash flow velocity. Working capital solutions like notional pooling, for example, let you automate and mobilize your excess cash more easily than ever; you can centralize cash management without actually comingling funds or making intercompany loans. Instant access to balances and pending transactions can create other advantages. With real-time solutions, you can make confident decisions in where to spend, where to invest, and how to best use your funds to achieve your business goals.  7. Empower customer service Who hasn’t wondered about the status of an order or when an important payment will arrive? It’s not just a question that finance struggles to answer—employees want to track expense reimbursements; customers and suppliers need accurate data to manage their own balance sheets and update their stakeholders. Real-time access to banking data will be able to supercharge your customer service. Instead of lengthy phone calls or strings of emails, imagine completing payment-related activities directly from your customer-facing mobile app, website, or product. With embedded commerce, you can design the workflow; your bank can supply the data to support your full order-to-cash lifecycle. Make instant data access a priority for treasury Instant access to financial data can accelerate operations, improve decision-making, and increase productivity. It brings benefits that extend far beyond treasury management, to senior leadership, valued customers, and trading partners. There’s no better time than now to talk with your bank about adding real-time capabilities.

Account takeover fraud occurs when a fraudster obtains confidential information – including user IDs, passwords, PINs, and token codes – and uses it to access online banking accounts, transfer funds, or commit other fraudulent acts. Fraudsters gain access by tricking you to divulge your online banking credentials or installing malicious software (malware) on your devices. Download our checklist (PDF) to help reduce your risk of account takeover fraud.

If you’re a B2C business, creating a modern billing and payment experience can reach valuable customers and set your company apart. Younger buyers, in particular, consider flexible payment options and convenient digital tools as “table stakes” when choosing their preferred providers.  One-quarter of Millennials, for example, report prioritizing for payment those bills “with the least payment friction.” Another study notes that when given the option, 60 percent of consumers have used a digital wallet (such as  Apple Pay or Google Pay) to pay their bills, attracted by the ability to “pay instantly.” Cash and checks are also in flux as more consumers opt for cards or digital methods. Six in 10 Americans now expect to see a cashless society in their lifetimes. How to stay current with B2C expectations Given all the options, moving your consumer receivables forward can seem overwhelming. Where should you start? Which payment methods should you accept? How can you offer consumers more choices, while at the same time, keep your processing costs and accounts receivable (AR) workload under control? A step-by-step approach will make the process manageable.  Step 1: Make digital-first a priority Before making any changes, look at your customer base and get a better understanding of how and when they want to pay you. Consider also your business model.   Are you a “receipt-only” business where purchase and payment occur simultaneously, such as a coffee shop, an auto repair facility, an online bookstore, or an e-ticketing site?  Or, are you a “receivables” business like a dentist’s office, insurance company, or utility that needs to issue regular invoices, creating a longer and more complicated consumer collection cycle?   Once you know more about your target audience and their payment preferences, you can choose the right electronic payment options. Security and ease of use will be two important criteria so you can make digital payment convenient for consumers, without adding fraud or other risks to your business practices.  Step 2: Streamline your AR workload Adding new billing and payment options is not without its challenges, especially when B2C companies work with numerous payment providers. It can be difficult to create a streamlined and cost-effective solution across many vendors and systems.  As your business invests in electronic billing and payments, involve your bank in an open dialogue about your receivables goals and challenges. Many times, simple changes can make a big impact for AR teams and your bottom line.  For example, if you’re a receivables business that issues customer bills, make sure you’re using digital invoices with a “pay now” button. Your bank can host the electronic payment options of your choice on a secure website that’s branded to your business. A “pay now” feature can significantly increase payment speed and reduce the hassle of accepting checks.  If your customers pay through online bill pay sites, you can optimize your cash flow and increase straight-through processing with a bank-hosted electronic lockbox, or “eBox.” This service aggregates and standardizes all the digital payments you receive through online bill pay sites. Instead of checks and missing information from these third-parties, you receive electronic deposits and consolidated posting files with the account and invoice numbers you need. Step 3: Keep modernizing The consumer payment landscape continues to evolve, as do customer expectations. Fortunately, payment billing and innovations are keeping pace. Savvy B2C businesses are keeping tabs on solutions such as buy now, pay later (BNPL) short-term financing at point-of-sale, faster payment options like the FedNow service, and new ways to integrate mobile devices into the B2C purchase experience. Consumers appear ready to take invoicing and payments by SMS text messaging into the mainstream. They recognize that a text or email reminding them a bill is due makes it easier to pay on time. They also value “pay now” links embedded in reminder messages which make it easier to complete an online payment.   These and other payment innovations give B2C companies a range of ways to satisfy consumers, optimize your cash conversion cycle, and differentiate your business. Your bank can help you navigate the options and choose the solutions that best meet your specific needs.

Helping you streamline online bill payment processing  Initiating bill payments through a single, trusted banking site may be convenient, simple, and paperless for your customers, but the convenience enjoyed by consumers as they schedule their payments online does not always proceed through the Bill Service Provider (BSP) to the Biller. This is due to the fact that many payments, initially submitted online, still end up being mailed out as paper checks by the BSP. These check-only payments create exceptions and often have incomplete or inaccurate remittance details, which can result in further processing delays. The Wells Fargo E-Box® service is a comprehensive solution, enabling you to manage your online remittance process in a consolidated electronic data stream. With flexible multi-step validation and exception handling options, the E-Box service helps you maximize your straight-through electronic processing rate and minimize your exceptions.  Extensive connectivity to major originating endpoints  Wells Fargo connects to all major originating endpoints, including our extensive network of third-party concentrators, to help you maximize your electronic payments. Leverage the experience of our dedicated E-Box staff in working with billers from multiple industries, including energy and power, financial services, media and telecommunications, the public sector, and originators to implement an efficient electronic receivables solution.  The Wells Fargo advantage   Consolidated file and settlement. You receive a single remittance file and settlement for all online bill payments.  Select from one or more of our convenient processing windows.  Extensive provider network. Maximize electronic payment volume and reduce paper check payment processed, speeding up delivery time when payments are processed electronically, creating a better customer experience.  Robust account validation. With multi-step validation including account masking format, cross reference database processing and the use of inbound validation files, incorrect billing account data provided by consumers can be corrected automatically.  Efficient exception management. Streamline your staff’s workflow around exception items to enhance process efficiency, improve productivity, and minimize costs. Through E-Box Decisioning on our Commercial Electronic Office® (CEO®) portal, you can view, research, and return completed transaction, make decisions on pending transactions, and gain access to information for purposes of reporting and trend analysis.

Key information about surcharging:  May not exceed the lower of either (a) the maximum rate permitted by each payment network or (b) the actual processing cost. May not be applied to debit cards or prepaid cards. Supported by Visa, Mastercard®, American Express® OptBlue, and Discover®. The lowest surcharge rate must apply to all payment networks. Must be the only cardholder fee charged by the merchant (it can’t be charged in addition to a service fee). State laws may vary, so it’s important to consult your legal counsel to determine your obligations and if fees are regulated or prohibited before implementing any cardholder fee.

Overview

Reports




We’re creating smarter ways for U.S.-based companies and their subsidiaries to manage their global business. With Wells Fargo helping with your international treasury strategy, you’ll have the advantage of one banking relationship that offers both U.S. and in-region implementation and technical support. We can help you strengthen your relationships with your overseas employees, customers, and vendors because you’ll transact with them in currencies that best meet your needs and theirs. Our electronic payment and reporting services are available using one online platform with robust security, our Commercial Electronic Office® (CEO®) portal. You can also use CEO Mobile®, as available in a geographic region, to monitor your accounts, approve transactions, and receive reporting on the go. We offer: Simplified cash management  Manage your Wells Fargo accounts online — CEO connects your offices, operations, and subsidiaries so you can work conveniently and efficiently. Potentially accelerate your cash flow from foreign receivables — make and collect payments in region. Increase visibility into your global cash position — on one single sign-on platform you’ll have end of day and intraday reporting in the same formats for all your Wells Fargo accounts and accounts you hold with other banks.  Easier transactions  Transact throughout the world in multiple currencies — you’ll settle to accounts in those currencies. Where you have receivables that match your required payables currencies, pay your trading partners and others without converting one currency to another — you’ll potentially reduce your foreign exchange cost.  For more resources and insights, read Business Viewpoints.


Our global accounts can help you manage your international operating flows in ways very similar to your day-to-day U.S. treasury activities. You can keep your familiar Wells Fargo banking relationships, customer service, and online access, so that you achieve the simplicity you want. U.S. Foreign Currency Accounts If you’re concerned about foreign exchange risk or the additional due diligence of overseas bank accounts, then a Wells Fargo U.S. Foreign Currency Account may be your best solution. We offer 28 currencies. Because you transact in the account’s currency, you can make outbound wire payments and deposit wire receivables without foreign exchange transaction costs. Because you hold these accounts in the U.S., you no longer need to prepare Foreign Bank Account Reporting (FBAR). Moreover, these accounts are eligible for Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) insurance. How it works  You open an account using a process similar to opening a U.S. demand deposit account. You send wire payments securely cross border from the U.S. using the same channel you use for your U.S. dollar (USD) accounts: CEO® Wires, Foreign Exchange on CEO®, Payment Manager®, or SWIFT services. You receive incoming wire transfers from around the world and incoming book transfers from your other U.S. Wells Fargo accounts. You optionally manage your cash — and cover overdrafts — by establishing a zero or target balance structure so that cash balances move automatically to a parent account.  Accounts for Canada Our in-country international bank accounts in USD and Canadian dollar give you the ability to send and receive electronic payments within Canada and cross border.,  They’re the basis of our Canadian treasury management solutions. Accounts for the U.K., Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA) With choices for British pound (GBP), Euro (EUR), and USD as well as 17 other currencies, a U.K. branch account lets you make non-urgent (Bacs), GBP Faster Payments, and urgent high-value GBP payables and receivables. In addition, approximately 600 partner bank branches throughout the U.K. provide over-the-counter services. You can also initiate and receive same day EUR payments throughout Europe. For non-urgent payments, you can take advantage of the simplified payment format for Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) for both payables and receivables. These accounts are the basis of our EMEA treasury management solutions.


With cross-border and in-country options, you can flexibly make and collect international payments.  Global ACH — With a U.S. USD account, you can send repetitive, non-urgent batch payments (ACH credits) in nine currencies using our Global ACH service. With a U.K. branch account, you can use the same online service to send ACH credits in 11 currencies, so that you can reach more than 40 countries and territories. Beneficiaries receive electronic payments typically within two to five business days. Wire transfers — You can send and receive wires conveniently using the initiation option that suits your needs: online, consolidated payables, SWIFT, or (in the U.S.) application programming interface (API). Payment Manager® — You can streamline your global payments process by sending one file with multiple payment types and related remittance information. This consolidated payables service lets you send files from your internal system. We separate the payments by type and then process them accordingly. By reducing the use of paper documents and manual data entry, you can potentially minimize mistakes and increase efficiency. Foreign Exchange on CEO® — You can send foreign exchange wires 24 hours a day, six days a week online that settle to your commercial accounts. You’ll benefit from live market rates for more than 120 currencies. If you need to generate an audit trail, you can debit a foreign draft with your Wells Fargo USD account and then print it from your location. SWIFT — You can streamline your back office by routing all payments and other transactions to Wells Fargo through SWIFT, a reliable connectivity channel. With request for transfer functionality, you can move money out of non-Wells Fargo accounts, giving you the benefit of concentrating funds.  The following two services help U.S.-based companies receive payments from individuals and entities located outside of the U.S. Global Invoice Connect® Our Global Invoice Connect with TransferMate® service — an inbound payments solution for you — can give your customers in more than 60 countries and territories a convenient electronic payment option in more than 35 currencies. Our service provider provides electronic bill presentment in USD or in your customers’ local currencies and then collects your funds direct to your U.S. USD account. You always receive your full invoiced amount, no matter how your customers pay. Global Check Clearing Through our direct relationships with foreign correspondent banks, combined with high-volume processing, we’re able to offer a cost-effective way to clear checks in a variety of foreign currencies or drawn on foreign banks in eligible countries. Depending on your current method of handling foreign check payments, your funds availability timing may improve.


Our reporting services on CEO® help you can gain insight and control over your global cash picture. Through this secure single sign-on portal, you view details of your pending and posted transactions from a browser on your desktop or mobile device. Additionally, CEO Mobile®, available in select geographic regions, gives you access to reporting on the go. You can alternatively obtain treasury reports by API, Direct BAI, SWIFT, and ISO 20022 channels. Treasury Information Reporting Our Treasury Information Reporting service on CEO delivers previous day composite and intraday composite reports with comprehensive balance, summary, and transaction details. We also provide reporting specific to electronic payment transactions. You can view and download reports for use in your accounting, treasury workstation, enterprise resource planning (ERP), or system of record.

IBAN stands for International Bank Account Number. It identifies an individual account, at a specific financial institution, in a particular country and is used to process financial transactions between institutions in different countries. Used correctly, the IBAN facilitates faster payment processing. Refer to the IBAN registry (PDF) for a list of countries that require IBANs and each country’s unique IBAN format. SWIFT (Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication) is the official IBAN registrar.



IBAN Format


Using IBAN


SWIFT BIC




The IBAN model creates a standard for account numbering among multiple countries. The model requires certain components to be present in all IBANs, but also allows for some flexibility for country-specific requirements. By adding components to existing account numbers, the IBAN improves a bank’s ability to process cross-border payments without having to manually repair transactions or replace existing account numbers. If you do not use the IBAN in countries that require its use, your payments might be returned without processing. An IBAN consists of up to 34 alphanumeric characters, which include the following:   Country code  – the ISO (International Organization for Standardization) country code   Check digits  – two check digits provided by the issuing financial institution based on a calculation that takes into account the entire IBAN   Bank identifier  – code that identifies the financial institution and, when appropriate, the branch of that financial institution servicing an account   Basic bank account number (BBAN)  – code that identifies an individual account, at a specific financial institution, in a particular country   Sample IBAN Format         Country Code Check Digits Bank Identifier Basic Bank Account Number (BBAN)     GB 76 PNBP 165671 12345678    Refer to the IBAN registry (PDF) for a list of countries that require IBANs and each country’s unique IBAN format.


When preparing your transaction:  Insert the IBAN in the account number field on any forms or screens used to create the payment Do not use both the account number and the IBAN. Remitters sometimes mistakenly insert the account number in the account number field and the IBAN in the bank-to-bank reference field or the OBI (Originating Beneficiary Information) field. Doing so will cause the payment to stop for repair at the beneficiary bank, negating the purpose of the IBAN. Instead, simply place the IBAN, which includes the account number, in the account number field. Include both the beneficiary’s IBAN and SWIFT BIC when making international payments destined for countries that participate in the IBAN registry (see “SWIFT BIC” tab). 


SWIFT BICs (business identifier codes), which are often called SWIFT codes, are a series of either eight or 11 alphanumeric characters that help to identify a specific financial institution. The number includes a bank code, a country code, a location code, and an optional branch code. Sample BIC         Bank Code Country Code Location Code Branch Code     PNBP GB 2L XXX (Represents the head office location)    Including an IBAN and a SWIFT BIC in wire instructions potentially will keep your wire fees lower because financial institutions in the beneficiary’s country may choose to either charge an additional fee for, or return, wires that do not include these numbers. Refer to our international resources for more information on SWIFT BIC numbers and other payment directories. Learn more about SWIFT.

Despite frequent fraud attempts, many businesses do not suffer financial losses because they implement strong fraud protection strategies. Is your organization protected?

Check fraud
Checks continue to be the payment method most often exposed to fraudulent activity. If your company writes checks or maintains checking accounts, we recommend you review the following services to ensure all your checking accounts have the fraud prevention and detection services for your company:  Positive Pay systematically compares checks presented for payment to your issued-check files to detect serial numbers and dollar amounts that don’t match. Payee validation identifies payee names that do not match the payee name information sent on your check issue files. Reverse Positive Pay is an alternative to positive pay services for companies unable to transmit issued-check files to Wells Fargo. You get the opportunity to review checks presented for payment and determine if they should be paid or returned. Payment Authorization enables you to place controls on your accounts that help to prevent fraudulent activity, specifically unauthorized checks and over the counter debits. 


ACH fraud
If you make ACH payments, these services can help protect you:   Wells Fargo ACH Fraud Filter – The "Stop" service automatically stops all ACH debits – except those you specifically pre-authorize – from posting to your accounts. The "Review" service presents transactions to you for pay or return decisions.     Perfect Receivables® service – If your company has a high volume of electronic receivables, reduce the risk that your account number will fall into the wrong hands. The  Perfect Receivables  service protects your account by providing "proxy" account numbers for your customers to use when remitting ACH and wire payments to you.  





Report Fraud
Act fast and follow these important steps immediately if you think you or your company might be the victim of a fraud or attempted fraud.

=== Contents of com-insights-treasury-insights-3-essentials-strengthen-cyber-security-.txt ===

 For CFOs and treasury professionals, sleepless nights are nothing new, especially when it comes to cyber risk management. Sophisticated new threats emerge constantly, each with the potential to disrupt company payments, communications, or operations. Ransomware, denial of service attacks, and business email compromise are just a few of the popular tactics in use today. Establishing a mature cyber security program helps provide robust protection from these and other issues so finance can fulfill its mission. While the information or cyber security teams typically spearhead such an initiative, treasury management can play a critical role.  The strongest cyber security programs align with overall business strategy, creating a unified approach for assessing risk across the business. For treasury, it starts with open dialog to understanding how finance systems, processes, and payments fit into your company’s overall cyber defenses.  Strive for top-down support and cross-functional participation As you dive into cybersecurity, you may hear the phrase “cyber everywhere,” which refers to the ubiquitous nature of cyber threats in today’s complex and digitally connected world. An effective and mature cyber program should encompass a layered security environment of people, processes, and technology. This approach will aggressively and continually mitigate risk and enable you to build capabilities for future protection. Mature cyber security programs focus on security, vigilance, and resilience:  Security — Implementing policies, procedures, and cyber strategies to prevent and detect threats.  Vigilance — Rapidly detecting threats and attacks.  Resilience — Responding and recovering from attacks to restore business operations.  Visible, top-down support is another hallmark. Active involvement by senior leaders emphasizes the importance of cyber security to employees at levels and across all lines of business. Evolve your cyber maturity in these three areas Developing a mature cyber security program means taking a systematic and proactive approach to counteract potential threats. Here are three areas where treasury management can support your company’s efforts and help move your program forward.   Identify and detect threats   When you know the issues most likely to impact your business, it becomes easier to deploy the right protections. A mature cyber security program continually assesses risk factors, then develops processes to monitor and detect potential issues. With today’s interconnected landscape, your lens needs to look beyond internal systems, processes, and people; risk assessments and protections also need to flow through your vendors and supply chain.   Treasury can support your company efforts by sharing knowledge from your bank and payment providers and making sure finance staff understand their role in maintaining a secure environment. Assess organizational readiness   Once you’ve identified potential risks, your company can start to transform systems and processes to better defend your organization. Cross-functional planning sessions and tabletop exercises are two ways to assess your readiness, find gaps, and document resources. Treasury management should be a key participant when exploring any payment-related scenarios.  Respond and recover quickly   The final step toward cyber maturity establishes business continuity plans that indicate how you’ll manage daily operations if a cyber issue does occur. These may include setting up parallel system or processes, identifying critical communications, or testing alternative options with banks, vendors, and other providers. Advance preparation will help you respond and recover quickly.  Continually monitor and improve Just as cyber threats continually evolve, so should your company’s cyber security program. Achieving “maturity” is a continual journey without a clear finish line. However, the more your organization works together to assess and improve, the more resilience your company develops to keep pace with current and future risk factors.

Wedded to spreadsheets and manual data entry? Enjoying the grind of month-end close on day seven? Thrilled at the latest forecast that’s outdated by the time it’s built?  Few treasury professionals would say “yes” to these scenarios. It’s why automation projects are proliferating across finance. There are faster, better ways to work. However, getting corporate stakeholders to invest in treasury projects can be a tough sell. After all, the traditional view holds that accounts payable and receivable are cost centers, not profit-makers.  APIs are game-changers for treasury automation That perception is changing, especially as more businesses realize the competitive advantages that speed, accuracy, and automation can bring. It makes getting your treasury automation project on the corporate To Do list feasible—particularly when you advocate for new solutions that make it faster, easier, and less expensive to update systems, compared to lengthy custom development cycles.  APIs are one of these game-changers.  APIs are prebuilt connections that link company systems (such as an ERP, treasury workstation, mobile app, or payment website) directly to bank products and services, for “always on” exchange of information. Unlike batch processing that happens at set timeframes, or portals and file transfers that require user intervention, APIs move information automatically. The result is instant access to banking information, payments, and other services—without downloading files, waiting for reports, or re-entering data between systems.  How to get traction for your API project To get your API initiative on the radar, along with appropriate funding and IT resources,  build your business case with these three steps.  1. Think big First, start by envisioning what success looks like. Document your current systems and processes, then identify the friction points that impede efficiency, accuracy, or customer service.  Look for opportunities such as:  When do you re-enter data? Where do you use multiple systems to complete an activity? How is the current process impacting staff productivity, corporate decision-making, or customer experience?  This is the time to dream big. Ask for input from a variety of roles, from those who “do” the day-to-day work (such as treasury analysts and frontline accounts payable and receivable clerks) to those who make strategic decisions (such as the head of finance). Involve your bank for perspectives from similar organizations and those outside your industry.  2. Start small Next, prioritize your efforts. Take the big picture opportunities from step one and find small yet high value projects that you can complete quickly and easily, with measurable results. The goal is to show stakeholders the value of automation within a few weeks or months, so you can gain credibility, build traction, and continue funding across multiple budget cycles.  Consider the feasibility of API projects like these:  Automating reconciliation with real-time access to balances and transaction details Streamlining vendor payments with instant confirmation that bank accounts are open and valid Implementing a faster payment method for immediate payment needs, such as contractor reimbursements  Once you’ve narrowed your options, invite your bank and your IT team to the table. Review available APIs and develop requirements specific to your use cases and internal systems.  Most importantly, quantify your projected efficiency gains from automating your treasury processes. Depending on the maturity of your company and your business model, this could include supporting rapid growth without needing to hire new staff, or improving productivity to reallocate existing team members to higher value activities.  3. Learn fast To close your business case, focus on timing. APIs are significantly faster to deploy—and easier to learn and use—compared to buying and training users on new systems, or investing in file transfer capabilities. Work with your project team, IT department, and your bank to find a first project that gets you up-and-running quickly. Demonstrate in your business case how you’ll track improvements, measure ROI, and document future opportunities. Stakeholders will appreciate knowing how you’ll apply your learnings to future endeavors and use their corporate support wisely.  Create momentum beyond a single API project Whether you’re looking to expedite payments, receivables, or reconciliation, or simply to mitigate risk by avoiding manual data entry, the benefits of APIs will be immediate and quantifiable. Using a “think big, start small, learn fast” approach will ensure your automation journey starts strong and maintains momentum for years to come.

The swivel.  If you work in a finance function, you’re familiar with it. It’s the endless movement between multiple screens and applications, “swiveling” back and forth to gather information, manually re-enter data, and complete your daily work.  Finally, the end of the swivel is in sight. Companies of all sizes are automating these routine activities with powerful APIs. They’re accelerating access to information, vastly improving efficiency, and making real-time treasury a reality.  Making real-time treasury possible  Just what is real-time treasury? It’s more than a corporate buzzword; it’s the next horizon for finance. Instead of relying on batch processing and next-day timeframes, real-time treasury delivers data as it happens, directly into company systems. It arms stakeholders with the insights needed for strategic decision-making in real time and simplifies the workload for frontline staff.  APIs are central to achieving real-time treasury. These machine-to-machine interfaces relay information with lightning-fast speeds and with “always on” connectivity. Unlike batch processing that happens at set timeframes, or portals and file transfers that require user intervention, APIs move information automatically.  APIs are not new, but they are seeing mainstream adoption. (Wells Fargo introduced our first APIs and our developer gateway in 2016; we now offer more than 40 proven APIs.)  One of the reasons behind the groundswell—particularly at mid-market companies—is the ease of use that APIs offer. With their “plug and play” functionality, APIs require far less time, effort, and IT resources to implement compared to custom development. They’re equally seamless for users, who find the data they need at their fingertips, without cumbersome swiveling between platforms and portals.  Creating value for staff, customers, and suppliers  APIs bring numerous advantages. Employing these system-to-system connections to your bank can help companies:   Do business more easily. APIs reduce the number of steps and systems it takes to accomplish your goals. Employees can work more productively or redeploy their time to higher value activities compared to downloading files and entering data.  Operate in real-time. Instead of waiting minutes, hours, or even days to obtain transaction data, APIs enable instant, “always on” access to critical information. You can spend more time making decisions and less time hunting for data.  Maximize your investment. Using pre-developed and proven functionality can eliminate weeks and even months from your development cycle. APIs work with most systems that treasury already uses, helping you improve ROI and reduce development costs.  Reduce your risk. APIs deliver up-to-the-minute information, making it possible to settle payments instantly, reconcile transactions daily, and spot fraud attempts quickly. In addition, leveraging APIs from regulated financial institutions safeguards your all-important data by ensuring you integrate with secure and compliant endpoints.  Enhance your customer experience. APIs can help you meet—and exceed—the high expectations that customers, suppliers, and employees bring to their daily activities. The flexibility of APIs and numerous pre-developed options let you identify use cases and create the ideal workflow that meets your needs.   API use cases meet broad range of finance needs  Leading banks offer a range of prebuilt APIs designed to facilitate everything from immediate balance inquiries to transacting faster payments to reconciling in real-time. Ongoing customer feedback and collaboration mean new automation options come to market regularly.  Some of the most popular treasury management APIs include:   Instant visibility into available cash balances  Consolidated multi-bank reporting to streamline cash forecasting  Automated posting to your general ledger or client accounts  Issuing and receiving a variety of faster payments, including Same Day ACH, RTPs, and FedNow   Innovative financial institutions also offer APIs that support broader financial activities. These include solutions for working capital management in the capital markets, and ways for organizations with inventory financing to manage approvals and invoices related to their commercial lines of credit. All benefit from the swift and automated exchange of information.  More options, more automation for treasury The evolution of APIs doesn’t end there. Leading banks are working with ERP providers to develop even smarter API functionality that will deliver the data treasury management needs directly into your system-of-record—without extensive IT resources. These “embedded banking” solutions will maximize convenience and simplify implementation.  APIs offer impressive opportunity for businesses to streamline their banking activities and move real-time treasury from vision to reality. Best of all, they signal an end to the “treasury swivel” and a new way to automate, optimize, and use your team’s talents effectively.

Transcript: Treasury Take: Balancing digital change

[MUSIC UP] Wells Fargo Global Treasury Management Treasury Take A collection of Global Treasury management videos featuring client business leaders sharing knowledge, experience, insights and strategies. What it truly means to digitize your organization Balancing digital changes Adam Rigby  Senior lead Digital Product Manager  Wells Fargo Global Treasury Management Michelle Austin  Chief Financial Officer  Smith Bagley, Inc. Adam Rigby: Digitizing your organization can take a number of different forms. I am Adam Rigby with Wells Fargo and today I have with me Michelle Austin from Smith Bagley, Inc., the Chief Financial Officer, to talk about what her experience has been like digitizing her organization. Michelle, a host of internal and external factors can impact when you make a decision for your organization. Can you talk about what it means to choose between an incremental or transformational change for your business? Michelle Austin: For Smith Bagley, we really haven’t made any transformational changes yet, I think our changes so far have been, you know we’re just getting our feet wet into the digitization and our changes have been minimal. We’ve been able to really offset any costs with some minor changes elsewhere. So, I think, down the road, now that we’re on this path, it’s a great path for us, and I think we’ll be looking for additional changes going forward.  Back to Adam: So, you mentioned costs, can you talk a little about the cost analysis you do when you’re deciding between if I should make a change or stay with the status quo? Back to Michelle: So, within Smith Bagley costs, we don’t have a set aside budget, necessarily, for this digitization in our company. However, what we look at is in terms of efficiencies. So, with the changes, even with the simple ones we’ve made today, we have actually realized some direct cost benefits and time savings benefits. As a small company you know we not able to reduce head count but what we have been able to do is reallocate labor proportionately. Back to Adam: Thank you Michelle, I appreciate you joining us here today. Back to Michelle: You’re very welcome, thanks for having me.

 Criminals thrive on opportunity. They look for weaknesses in systems or processes, then exploit them. When they find a scheme that works, they often deploy it against numerous companies.  Cyber-attacks that follow this pattern appear regularly. Often, threat actors systematically target a specific industry or type of business, wreaking havoc across a single sector. Recent ransomware incidents in the healthcare and services industries such as LockBit offer a prime example.  One way to protect your business is by updating your playbook with a community approach to cyber security.  Expand cyber security beyond your company walls Many businesses have strong internal programs to monitor, detect, and prevent cyber threats. These typically include protocols for company systems, employees, and processes. Communication is also critical. The information security or IT team develops ways to assess risk and share necessary information with company leaders and frontline employee.  Taking cyber security beyond your company walls can arm your business with an additional layer of protection. It may seem counter-intuitive but collaborating with others in your industry or geographic market (and even your competitors) can provide a number of benefits. These advantages include:  Obtaining vital early awareness on new and emerging cyber threats Learning best practices and techniques to improve security Keeping up with new and pending legislation   Invite public and private sector participants Building your community means developing relationships with cyber security professionals outside your company. At first, it may seem strange to work toward a common goal with leaders from other companies. But the more you can find areas of cooperation, the greater the benefit to all involved.  Transparent conversations about what you are seeing or experiencing are key. It also helps to realize that every company will have its own approach to cyber security, and its own tolerance for risk. More sophisticated organizations will likely be more active in monitoring and detecting potential threats, as well as educating others on tactics and best practices.  An effective industry-wide coalition typically includes:  Private sector businesses of all sizes Trade associations Legislative and governing bodies at state and national levels Critical vendors and supply chain resources  Your business still needs an internal cyber security program. However, working together with industry peers helps increase vigilance and resilience for all involved. Industry-wide communication can provide significant muscle to deter threat actors, reduce the impact of cyber-attacks, and decrease risk.

By John Hunter, Head of Global Treasury Management Payments and Transaction Services Wells FargoFor companies large and small, real-time speed and efficiency have arrived. Customers and stakeholders now expect immediate access to information, near-instant transactions, and all from the convenience of their preferred device or system.  Creating the treasury infrastructure to make real-time a reality is more valuable than ever. That’s because back-office functions like cash application, supplier payments, forecasting, and reporting now play a bigger, more vital role in a company’s overall brand and customer experience. It’s why more organizations are working proactively with their bank to develop synergies between their treasury platforms, their payment methods, and their core business functions. Too often, however, technology is the only consideration when companies plan a move from batch processing and legacy tools to the new capabilities available with APIs, webhooks, and other real-time solutions.  It’s just as important to fundamentally evolve your treasury processes, skills, and controls. Only with a shift in perspective will you truly maximize the opportunities that real-time solutions present. Future-proof your business with real-time capabilities Innovative real-time capabilities now span a range of functions, from real-time payments to multi-bank dashboards to automated notifications. It’s an exciting time, with leading banks, fintechs, ERP providers, and other players all unveiling new solutions regularly.  Adopting one or more of these capabilities now (and developing a roadmap for future solutions) helps your organization “future-proof” so you can fully support your customers, internal stakeholders, and key business partners.  Other benefits of real-time treasury solutions include:  Automating routine and redundant activities Attracting and retaining key talent Working efficiently and productively Making stronger business decisions, especially around liquidity Creating a competitive advantage in the market  As your organization crafts its real-time strategy, it’s important to realize the impacts of automation, speed, and visibility to your treasury processes and team. Rethinking the following three elements will set your organization up for success.  1. Rethink your processes Real-time operations dramatically accelerate the speed at which treasury operates. APIs help you replace batch processing, intraday or next-day reporting, and painstaking downloads of data with real-time transactions and instant access to information. Instead of swiveling between numerous platforms, spreadsheets, and portals, you can embed key functionality within your core back-office system—or even your customer-facing applications.  The switch to real-time means rethinking your processes. For example:  What does faster access to information and greater automation mean for staff who apply cash or do cash flow forecasting?  What risk management checkpoints, approvals, and controls need to change in order to safeguard company funds and data in a real-time environment?  How will working capital and liquidity management processes improve? How will your cash application processes change to accommodate real-time payments received on weekends or holidays?  Looking at these and other work flows can help you apply real-time treasury across your customer, supplier, and employee experiences.  2. Rethink your skills Historically, working in finance meant building out spreadsheets, moving data between systems, and even manual activities like printing and mailing customer invoices. Treasury management, accounts receivable, and accounts payable all hired team members versed in these routine tasks.  Now, there’s far more automation. As your organization adopts new solutions, it’s smart to rethink the skillsets you need and how you can redeploy your staff. With current, accurate information at your fingertips, there’s a greater need for those fluent in critical thinking, financial analysis, managing technology, and interpreting data; those who manually process payments, print checks, and reconcile accounts may need upskilling and education for the future.  3. Rethink your technology How your company manages systems is the final area to rethink. Fortunately, APIs and other real-time tools require fewer IT resources and far less investment, compared to custom development efforts of the past. That puts real-time within reach of small and large organizations alike.  It also expands the reach of treasury solutions. Real-time brings treasury beyond the back-office operations and into sales, customer service, and even product development. Rethinking your technology means taking a big picture approach, strengthening relationships across the organization, and working with the right external resources who can bring your business goals to life.  Minimize complexity by working with trusted providers Your bank can play a vital role in your transformation to real-time. You can minimize complexity by working through a few trusted resources rather than sourcing solutions from numerous, disconnected vendors. You can also transact with confidence, especially as more real-time transactions settle with irrevocable terms. It’s vital to safeguard both your data and funds at all points; your financial institution understands and adheres to strict regulations, with powerful fraud-fighting tools. Your bank can even operate as the “connective tissue” that links you to various payment networks, digital wallets, and other innovations that will streamline your workload and power your customer experiences.

Impostor fraud, also known as business email compromise (BEC), occurs when a criminal impersonates someone you know and trust such as a vendor, executive, or the IRS. The impostor contacts you by phone, email, fax, or postal mail and submits an invoice or requests a payment or a change to vendor payment instructions. This results in your payment going to the fraudster rather than where you intended. Unlike other types of fraud, impostor fraud is difficult to detect because the transactions made on your account are consistent with regular payments and are made by authorized personnel. Always verify sensitive requests using this checklist to help ensure you don’t miss an important step. Download checklist (PDF)

Kate Lewis, Accounts Receivable Specialist, started her job at Litehouse Inc. at the right time. Just weeks before, the food manufacturer launched Integrated Receivables (IR) from Wells Fargo. The sophisticated solution quickly transformed the company’s accounts receivable (AR), fully automating 95 percent of their U.S. cash application.  What often took her predecessor a full day, Lewis now handles in 1-2 hours. Gone are cumbersome spreadsheets, manual data entry, and hours spent tracking down details. Wells Fargo’s flexible IR tool applies the power of artificial intelligence and machine learning to expedite the company’s AR processes.  Bringing scale and efficiency to AR Wendy Gibson, Senior Accountant, manages Litehouse’s AR team. After 24 years with the company, working from their Sandpoint, Idaho, headquarters, she recognizes the scale, efficiency, and benefits that automation creates.  In a typical month, IR now automates the processing of more than $21 million in receivables. In a typical month, IR automates an average of 2,000 invoices per month and corresponding check and electronic payments resulting in significant time savings for the Litehouse Inc. team.  “I saw the IR implementation and I was blown away at how fast and easy it was!” Gibson said. “What used to take a person nearly all day—and sometimes into the next day—now can be done in just the morning hours.” Automation is nothing new to Litehouse. Prior to adding IR, they deployed Wells Fargo’s Payment Manager solution to streamline accounts payable (AP). “It works really well,” Gibson explained. “IR is the same concept, bringing in and matching payments automatically. To add receivables and get efficiencies here has been awesome.” Eliminating spreadsheets, manual work, and all-day effort Founded more than 60 years ago, Litehouse has grown from a local institution to a nationwide powerhouse. Their flagship products include a variety of high-quality salad dressings, dips, and salsas found in grocery stores, cafeterias, and restaurant chains around the country.  Processing the invoices and payments associated with a food service business, however, means nuances not found in other industries. With large customers, for example, a single check can cover dozens or even hundreds of open invoices. Customers also routinely apply discounts to their payments, reflecting everything from early payment to products damaged during delivery.  Unraveling those details required patience and hard work for Litehouse. The company uses a specialized ERP for manufacturers. While the system contains fields for discounts and other notes, the AR team could not apply cash directly in the ERP. First, they needed to match payments and open invoices, then balance each day’s cash in an Excel spreadsheet.  “The old way, you had to type everything into a spreadsheet, make sure everything balanced, and it was very cumbersome and time consuming,” Gibson recalled.  She added, “It used to take all day, and sometimes into the next day. We’d all have to pitch in and get caught up.” Automation reduces aging from millions of dollars to under $500,000 Now, only Canadian payments require a spreadsheet, and Litehouse looks forward to automating them with IR in the future.  Gibson and Lewis cite numerous advantages with IR, from reduced Days Sales Outstanding (DSO) and accelerated collections to greater productivity in the AR team.  “A year ago, our aging was very high—and now our 60-day report has shrunk from a few million dollars to under $500,000,” Gibson said. “Part of that is because Kate can get payments in, then move on to collections faster.” Lewis agrees. Her strength is collections; being able to apply each day’s cash quickly gives her ample time to for outreach to customers and other activities that create a positive impact on the bottom line.  “It’s the time factor,” Lewis explained. “If I had to post everything manually, it would take all day. IR gives me time to do other things—specifically collections and some deductions—without needing another person.” Managing growth without adding FTEs Senior management also appreciates the benefits of IR, especially the savings it creates as the company continues to expand. Litehouse Inc. has grown to include five owned brands and a handful of exciting licensing partners, like California Pizza Kitchen. IR has enabled Litehouse’s small AR team—just four specialists for invoicing, deductions, cash application, and collections—to keep up with the pace and they now have more capacity for other core activities.   “We’re just growing out of sight, but Integrated Receivables has helped us scale our business without needing to hire more  headcount,” Gibson said. “We would have needed another person to do collections if we kept working manually.” Gibson’s pride in their accomplishments comes from being not just the manager of AR, but a stakeholder in Litehouse’s future. The organization is 100% employee-owned, sharing values of integrity, stewardship, accountability, and excellence. Using IR helps them achieve these goals.  She encourages other organizations to make the switch to IR. Her advice?  “I’d tell them get with this century! We’re all looking for new efficiencies, and this is the way to go,” Gibson said. Lewis concurred, adding, “Integrated Receivables makes the process so time efficient—it really has been amazing.”

 FDA approval is a foundational requirement for many products developed by pharmaceutical and other healthcare startups, however a lot more preparation is required for commercial success. To create financial value, it is important that Pharma and Health Tech companies execute a well-orchestrated go-to-market strategy. Unfortunately, many companies, large and small, fail in this process due to both poor preparation and misjudging the complexities of scaling an organization quickly enough to seize the opportunities created by a successful product. Evolving Challenges since COVID-19  It is estimated that at least 90% of all startups fail which is representative of the healthcare market as well: 90% of startups in the healthcare market will fail or be “aqui-hired” (acquiring a company’s talent) within 2-5 years of launching. For Healthcare and Pharma startups, the product itself is rarely the problem: Failure is often the result of an unclear business model, the lack of a clear go-to-market strategy, or a poorly defined value proposition. During the COVID-19 pandemic, many investors looked to the public health and infectious disease space as the next big opportunity, but the obstacles facing these startups were even greater than in other sectors. Not surprisingly, the main challenges which startups usually face include finding customers and securing the investments needed for their innovations. During the pandemic when compared with pre-pandemic data, these challenges increased by 20% and 8% respectively. Post the COVID-19 pandemic, new capital has become increasingly harder to access and even more expensive due to increased risk in a volatile rate environment. While funding is still available, it has become more competitive than ever to gain investors' trust and investments. Venture Capital funds have begun looking more closely at underlying business models, growth strategies, and how successful products will be when launched at scale. Business Planning and Quality Control While influence in the industry and comprehensive business planning can increase the odds of commercial success, there are many circumstances out of our start-up clients’ control, including: the timing of an FDA approval, potential changes in regulation which might not get past the comment period or may require multiple iterations, delays in the next funding rounds, etc. Despite these points of uncertainty, a company can control the quality and efficacy of its business processes and controls, in addition to how it poises itself for success within its specialty. Investors are just as much interested in the efficacy of the product as the foundation and direction of the organization overall. Especially the finance and treasury function can use the time before the FDA approval to get business processes in order and look for opportunities to build out scalable processes. Examples of foundations which should be set early on include Finance and Treasury functions; taking advantage of the timeframe prior to FDA approval will allow a smooth implementation of business processes, thereby allowing for more opportunities to build out scalable processes. Cash flow is another particular financial measure to keep an eye on during periods of growth, especially in circumstances where additional venture funding is slower than in previous years, so paying careful attention to timing of cash flow will pay off now and in the future. By being attentive at the key moments to Treasury and Finance metrics, the growth trajectory of a startup can increase sustainably, keeping the interest of investors. Key infrastructure components which will need to be reviewed and put in place are the ERP system, HR platform, and digital payments ecosystem. Let’s look at each one in more detail and highlight how these relate to the high growth enablement. HR, ERP, and Electronic Payments  The implementation of an HR system to automate the HR related processes and functions of a startup are significant, and can occur either on a standalone basis, or an integrated one within the ERP. When set-up correctly, many HR related functions can be automated such as recruiting and training new employees, hiring, benefits administration, performance management, payroll, and tracking of compliance requirements. Especially in times of accelerated hiring and onboarding of new employees, the HR system needs to be scalable and compliant with the applicable state and federal regulations. ERP and HR applications are held to high cyber security standards are paramount in protecting proprietary and patient data for your startup. Many hosted and cloud-based solutions of HR and ERP systems support pay-as-you go models which reduce the need for an upfront investment and leave the operations of the systems and certain cyber security matters to third party providers. The third component involves setting up electronic payments and receivables processes that integrate with the aforementioned ERP and HR system. To ensure scalability, manual and paper-based processes should be avoided for these responsibilities. Electronic bank statements and commercial card files should be inputted into the ERP automatically to support auto reconciliation and identify exceptions, both of which would identify fraud quickly. If travel is a major requirement, a commercial travel card program will need to be established early on and will also need to support controls that align with policies and avoid sales practice issues. Pricing and Billing Models It is also important to think about different pricing and billing models early on which will need to be supported as part of the go-to-market strategy. Flexibility of the billing platform and integration into the Account Receivables process will be important in reducing lost revenue and in avoiding granting unwarranted discounts. Once a new product is on the market questions arise such as:    How will orders be created? What payment terms will be offered to different distributors of the product and how will adherence be tracked Is a sales force or regional representation required to promote the new product across the US or even internationally? Will discounts be provided for certain markets?  Once actual sales start taking place, a key metric which should be tracked is days receivables outstanding or DSO which measures the time it takes to collect receivables once invoices are issued. The first step in taking control of DSO starts by automating the invoicing and collection process and consider solutions that match incoming payments to remittance data automatically. To optimize DSO further, receivables financing solutions can also be reviewed, thus releasing cash as well as managing the risk on the companies’ balance sheet. On the payable side, the goal is to optimize the days payables outstanding (DPO). When the pay is too slow, discount may be missed, and when pay is too quick, there may be impact to the available cash. One option to extend payment timelines without jeopardizing supplier relationships can be the use of virtual cards to give suppliers immediate payment while the company retains its working capital up to 30 days. Data Protection and Privacy In addition to technology and reliable data, a scalable business will require policies and controls that need to be established and documented early in the lifecycle of the company.  Controls need to be enforced and their effectiveness will depend on the data quality and by the business workflows which the ERP and HR systems enforce consistently across the organization. In addition to good clinical practice (GCP), product safety and manufacturing policies, other policies, and controls to consider are:  Data protection and privacy policy governs how sensitive information such as personal data and confidential business information will be protected Information security policy outlines how information systems, networks, and data will be protected from unauthorized access, theft, and cyberattacks and what to do in case of a breach Compliance policy specifies the company's compliance with relevant laws and regulations including DA, EMA, and other regulatory agencies. Investment Policy governs investment objectives, asset allocation, risk tolerance, diversification and any restrictions Data Quality Policy sets procedures for ensuring the accuracy, completeness, and reliability of data across the organization HR policies covers Recruitment and hiring, Compensation and Benefits, Time Off and Leaves of Absence, and Health and Safety Accounting and Finance policies governs financial reporting, internal controls, revenue recognition, accounts receivable, accounts payable, cash management, budgeting, and tax planning  Well documented policies and controls, combined with the right technology will not only enable the company to grow its operation to scale quickly but also to confidently establish SOX reporting that can hold up to the scrutiny of external auditors, and also prepare the organization for their public filings when the time comes. Significance of Data in Securing Capital According to Deloitte, “…products and solutions that address well-being and care delivery, along with open, secure data and interoperable platforms, are likely to continue receiving the lion’s share of funding”. In addition to providing capital, investors and strategic partners should assume a consultative role, and bring their industry and regulatory experience to innovative startups. Advancing with technology and automation, enforcing policies and controls, establishing a unique value proposition, and most importantly, having a clear business model will all determine the success of a healthcare startup. When partnered with the best investors and consultants for them, innovators can continue to grow, improve quality of care, and deliver value to patients for a better future in healthcare. Investing in the readiness many months or years before the formal authorization is received by the FDA might not be intuitive but lacking the capabilities and functions will lead to performance challenges or avoidable risk exposures that can hurt the future success of the company. Creating the above-mentioned functions on the fly seldomly work and unreliable financial data will most certainly impact obtaining further funding, a public offering or sale of the company. To be successful, a company needs to find common ground with investors, customers, health care providers, patients, and potential acquirers early and often. Stakeholder input is needed early to avoid mistakes that can impede any chance of a success a company may have later down the road. Health care companies are required to amass specific evidence and data to achieve key milestones such as raising capital, regulatory clearance or approval, and obtaining insurance reimbursement or payment. A common mistake is thinking about evidence generation in a linear manner and focusing just on what is needed for the next milestone. This is a common and costly error that can significantly delay time to success. Far too many startups succeed in achieving a regulatory milestone but then run out of funding before generating sufficient evidence to convince customers to buy their products so effective budget planning and allocating is key when it comes to evidence generation. To avoid errors such as this, start conversations early with all relevant stakeholders about what data they will require. Also consider the Food and Drug Administration’s innovative Payor Communication Task Force; this task force involves public and private payers such as Medicare and Medicaid, private health plans, health technology assessment groups, and others in the pre-submission process in conjunction with a parallel review with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to potentially shorten the time between FDA approval and coverage decisions. It’s essential to know who will be paying for your products and how the reimbursement will work. Misunderstanding the complicated and ever-changing economics of payment reimbursements is a costly, and easy one to make. Many health care startups develop a strategy that will let them sell straight to consumers, thinking that it would be a simpler model. They assume this way they are able to skip the time and expense consuming regulatory approval. Angel investors with small pockets tend to favor this strategy. The problem is that this relies on the often-flawed assumption that consumers are willing to pay out of pocket for health-related products and services. Excluding the outliers who are early adopters of the out-of-pocket payments, most consumers naturally want their health plans to pay. As a result, consumer health startups often wind-up pivoting strategies in order to pursue a regulated device strategy, but many run out of the necessary funds before they get there. Making an informed decision on payments strategy early on will help to determine whether your startup will perform better by offering its innovations as regulated or as non-regulated products. Know Your Customers and all indications for your innovations We regularly see startups whose technology has multiple potential indications however they typically choose the initial indication based on the one the company founder knows the most about — a founder who is a liver cancer surgeon, for example, choosing liver cancer over breast cancer. This type of decision making isn’t always the right call, and the evidence generated in an incorrect initial indication can drain resources before you even have the chance to pivot. To arrive at the best indication, complete a value proposition analysis on all indications and choose the one which is the most compelling in terms of market size, competitive landscape, and patient adoption. These qualifiers should help inform the decision on which indication to initially prioritize and pursue. After arriving at this stage, you may think your technology will be adopted because of the potential for improved patient outcomes or lowering overall costs, but if it adds steps or changes a procedure for the ones who are administering your product or service, you are not just disrupting an industry, but the key stakeholders and decision makers. To have the greatest chance at success, the innovative health technology should integrate as seamlessly as possible into existing workflows, not delay, or interrupt them. Therefore, it’s essential to take ownership of knowing the details of every step and aspect of a customer’s workflow including every person who will be affected by it, because one weak link in the new process can potentially prevent your innovation from being adopted. For example, a surgeon may love your technology, but if it impacts a Nurse’s or Technician’s shift workload then an adoption hurdle will loom. Simulating conduct discovery, focus groups, and user testing with every key player in the actual impacted workflow in as many situations as possible can help clarify any pain points or inefficiencies before they become an obstacle in a live environment. Being mindful of the learning points outlined in this white paper should give you a clear starting point of which pain points in your growth you may anticipate and can tackle ahead of time with your business advisory team. Staying proactive in your business strategy at every stage, maintaining a strong brand vision, offering scalable products and services adaptable to serve multiple customer types are paramount for any healthcare startup. What is even more beneficial in addition to what all strong startups have is ensuring that all key stakeholders in your company structure have a comprehensive understanding of all payment and reimbursement dynamic options which are usually moving targets. Wells Fargo is here to help support all aspects of your startup through this exciting, innovative journey and will help you make your mark on the future of positive global healthcare outcomes. Your relationship manager will be pleased to provide more information on Wells Fargo’s financial strategies for the healthcare industry and other correspondent services.

Historically, automating tasks involved removing the people from processes. Today, digital transformation considers the human factor to be essential to systems design. Nowhere is this more vital than in fighting fraud. Key to success requires understanding the relationship between people and technology and developing systems and processes to enable people to supervise automated tasks. When automation alienates  While automation can streamline and simplify, it also often changes the tasks at hand. What was routine for employees can become unfamiliar or even more complex. For example, file encryption can add new steps. Shifting from in-person to online meetings introduces new processes. Technology typically changes how people fit into their environment, and this can be disruptive.  Trust but verify When it comes to fraud detection, every second counts. Technology is a key tool in fast detection. However, sometimes we blindly trust technology. If something doesn’t look right, we may overly rely on what machines tell us is happening while ignoring our common sense.   It’s important to trust but verify your technology. Human intuition is a key skill in early fraud detection and in critical thinking that can help to prevent fraud.   When introducing automation to fight fraud, the human element becomes more, not less important. People must remain a critical part of digital transformation. Even companies that invest in artificial intelligence should not lose sight of the value of human intelligence. Add sensemaking to your fraud detection arsenal Intuitive skills can help us to understand connections between information, circumstances, and our actions so that we can recognize situations, detect problems, and understand how to adapt and respond. This cognitive process is known as sensemaking.  If you are increasing your reliance on automation to detect fraud, human sensemaking becomes an important counterbalance. If you can’t afford to invest in technology, and your people remain your only front-line fraud defense, sensemaking is a particularly valuable skill.  Train employee intuition Making sense takes common sense. However, intuition can be an especially powerful resource when trained. How do you train your people in sensemaking?  Allow employees to trust but verify technology as part of their daily routine. Develop procedures and protocols that support this approach, and train people to follow them. Put checks and balances in place, such as reviewing key reports regularly. Build controls into your technology.  For example, include a human override or kill switch that pauses an automated process from advancing without approval. Cultivate employees not only as sensers but as innovators. It’s important to rely on employees not only to sense when something is wrong but to suggest better procedures. Establish a culture where employees feel comfortable to speak up when they find a better way of doing things, not only for detecting fraud but for preventing it. Training and educational opportunities support this kind of environment.  People are a key factor in fraud detection. Digital transformation aimed at fighting fraud should be designed with human oversight in mind. As part of this, it’s important to cultivate the ability for employees to sense when something is not right and to act accordingly.

With sales and other functions curtailed, payments are crucial to business viability, now may be the time to enhance your accounts receivable and payable by implementing the following strategies. Refine accounts receivable Move to electronic receivables. Checks require people to be physically present to handle them. If you’ve been meaning to move to electronic payments for efficiency reasons, this is a good reason to do it now. Talk to customers about paying you by ACH, RTP, or online, and redesign invoices to show your preferred payment methods. Talk to your bank about setting up electronic receivables services. Post unapplied payments. You want customers to buy from you again, and soon. Open their receivable accounts by researching and posting unapplied payments. Update your receivables accounts. Remove inactive accounts and duplicates. A clean list may help make processing payments faster and easier and help avoid exceptions. Review past-due accounts. Connecting with your customers is important. If they can’t pay the full amount, perhaps offer discounts or set up payment plans. You may want to add or assign resources to help bring in needed cash. Hone accounts payable Make more payments electronically. If you’re having trouble printing checks, your customers are having trouble receiving them. Offer electronic payment options such as ACH, RTP, and commercial card. Reach out to suppliers. If you have invoices that are difficult to process, tell your suppliers how they may help make your invoice processing easier. It may be as simple as including the P.O. number or invoice number on their bills. Clean up master vendor files. Vendor contact names, phone numbers, addresses, and terms keep changing. To help avoid duplicate payments and business email compromise (BEC) fraud, validate the information on file, remove duplicates, and archive inactive vendors. Handle uncashed checks. No one wants checks to go into escheatment. If you have checks uncashed past their stale dates, try to contact payees to learn why they haven’t been cashed. Moving away from check payments to electronic payments can lessen the likelihood of creating unclaimed property. Prepare for exigencies to come After Superstorm Sandy, the Great Recession, COVID-19, and more, who knows what’s coming next. Increase your preparedness with these BCP measures. Write or update standard operating procedures (SOPS). When you have turnover or absenteeism, structured process management will enable business as usual. Cross-train employees. Build bench strength so jobs will get done when the usual team members are unavailable. Conduct fraud training. Businesses are more vulnerable to fraud in times of turmoil. Increase fraud awareness – especially awareness of business email compromise fraud – through video conferencing or meetings. As you implement these best practices, you may gain insights into where and how you might improve your processes. Insights you can put into action when normalcy returns.

 As businesses navigate the current economic landscape, their treasurers are facing an increasingly complex and volatile environment. Two key areas of concern are the implications of high interest rates and supply chain risks. These factors can impact a company's liquidity position and working capital, making effective management of these areas of critical importance. High Interest Rates Interest rates are a crucial component of the financial system, influencing borrowing costs, savings rates, and investment returns. When interest rates rise, there are implications for treasurers, with two primary ways that high-interest rates can impact a business’s finances.  Firstly, the cost of refinancing debt increases. As interest rates rise, the cost of borrowing for companies also goes up. With 78.8% of investment-grade U.S. corporate debt maturing this year, the impact of higher borrowing costs for companies to refinance their debt can impact their cash flows and profitability. Treasurers need to assess the implications of rising interest rates on their organization’s debt servicing costs and develop strategies to mitigate the impact. At times like this, access to excess cash reserves and optimizing receivables management become paramount. Secondly, treasurers need to re-evaluate their hedging strategies. These could be both on and off-balance sheet. The more obvious hedges companies can take advantage of are where companies enter derivative hedging contracts to manage interest rate risk. When interest rates increase, the value of these contracts may change triggering calls on cash. There also remain the need for hedging embedded risks in a company’s supply chain. Supply Chain Risks The pandemic has disrupted global supply chains, increasing the focus on diversifying the supplier base and near-shoring production centers. However, these strategies also come with their own set of potential risks, such as increased freight costs, fewer discounts due to lower individual purchase orders and foreign exchange risk. Adding to this could be the differing approaches by central banks in their response to inflation and subsequent rate hikes which have increased volatility in the foreign exchange markets. All of this could trigger re-pricing clauses in supply contracts, increasing the demand for cash to fund payables. Managing Liquidity Positions and Working Capital Given the uncertainties in the current economic environment, treasurers should adopt a proactive approach to managing their liquidity positions and working capital. Some strategies that treasurers could use to manage their liquidity positions and working capital effectively include: 1. Improve visibility on cash flows and off-balance sheet liabilities Treasurers should have a clear understanding of their cash flow requirements and develop robust cash flow forecasting models to manage their liquidity positions effectively. Treasurers should work closely with the business development and procurement teams to advise them on the re-pricing risks embedded in supply contracts and to thereafter include these contingent liabilities into their cash flow projections. These should be considered when procurement might not be able to lock in pricing for future deliveries creating uncertainty for cash outflows and their timing. 2. Optimize working capital across the supply chain Treasurers should work closely with their procurement and supply chain teams to optimize their working capital, as they could potentially reduce the amount of cash tied up in inventory and accounts receivable and have plans ready to extend payables if required. 3. Work closely with suppliers Given the supply chain risks, treasurers may work closely with suppliers through their procurement teams to ensure they are meeting their contractual obligations and to develop contingency plans in case of disruptions and shipping delays even as their companies execute plans to diversify their supplier base. 4. Consider alternative financing options Treasurers could consider alternative financing options, such as factoring or supply chain finance, to improve their liquidity positions. Smaller companies could benefit from supplier financing if the supplier has lower financing costs. For smaller ticket items, corporate purchase card programs could be considered. 5. Work closely with their bank Treasurers should review their bank’s capital, short term liquidity metrics, and discuss their lending capacity. Treasurers should ensure that their bank is aware of any refinancing or new financing plans. Conclusion The current economic environment is characterized by high interest rates and supply chain risks, making it critical for treasurers to manage their liquidity positions and working capital effectively. By focusing on cash flow forecasting, optimizing working capital, refocusing on supply chain risks, and considering alternative financing options, treasurers can mitigate the impact of these risks on their working capital in an effort to ensure that their organizations remain financially stable.

With rates rising and the cost of funds increasing, there’s a new sense of urgency for companies to improve efficiency, reduce expenses, and maximize liquidity. Centralizing some or all treasury management functions, such as cash management, helps achieve this goal.  Transforming treasury operations is not a new concept. However, it’s become more critical as treasury management’s role in the organization grows more strategic.  A centralized treasury structure provides greater visibility, improves control, and automates and streamlines processes. It arms senior leaders with the information and systems needed to make insightful decisions and act quickly. Centralizing cash management yields many benefits Cash management is one of the best places to centralize because the benefits will be immediate and tangible. It enables you to access your daily cash position quickly and easily, then make strategic decisions about excess funds and idle cash with speed and agility.  Numerous other benefits are possible with a centralized structure. Treasury can take advantage of:  Standard processes, controls, and metrics across the entire organization that streamline daily work, reduce risk, and improve treasury’s line of sight.  A single entity managing risk, which simplifies counterparty relationships and lets global organizations take greater advantage of natural hedging for foreign exchange (FX). Stronger working capital and liquidity management which can minimize external borrowing requirements and increase return on equity (ROE). Increased operational efficiencies, made possible with fewer bank accounts to manage, optimal FTE staffing, and for more sophisticated companies, shared service centers for payables, receivables, and other transactions.  Move toward centralization with these fundamental first steps Moving away from a decentralized structure can seem overwhelming. But, like many journeys, the hardest part is often figuring out where to begin.  First, establish your company’s long-term vision for centralization. Use your bank as a resource at this stage—they can help you compare options, share best practices, and provide insight into how similar companies handle their cash management and liquidity. Next, identify discrete short-term projects that are manageable in scope and can deliver measurable results. Consider these key elements: Get buy-in from stakeholders. No strategic project works well without top-down support. Enlist C-suite and line of business leaders for sponsorship and input, then keep them up-to-date on progress and early wins. Rationalize your bank accounts. Start with an inventory of banks and accounts across the organization. Identify the type and purpose of each, along with ownership and signatory capabilities. Look at currencies as well. This exercise will help you standardize across entities, ensure the right controls are in place, and as needed, consolidate for more efficient banking relationships and liquidity management.  Evaluate local versus central control. Centralizing cash management and other treasury management functions doesn’t have to be “all or nothing.” Hybrid options can give ownership to local entities while simultaneously automating processes, strengthening oversight, and improving cash management. Work with your bank to understand your options, then match strategies to your desired level of control.  Review technology options. In the past, centralizing meant arduous IT integrations and lengthy timeframes. Today, even in-house banks require very little IT effort, thanks to cloud-based solutions, real-time connectivity with APIs, and automated ledger entries. Achieving your goals may be faster and more cost-effective than you think, with banks, fintechs, and ERP providers all delivering “plug and play” solutions.  Take advantage of early wins Just as the journey image implies, change and centralization won’t happen overnight. But, every decision that standardizes a process, automates a workflow, or centralizes access to cash will help treasury operate more effectively. Set appropriate expectations with stakeholders, then work with your bank to find early wins you can measure, celebrate, and build from.


=== Contents of com-insights-treasury-insights-rtp-fednow-comprehensive-instant-payment-strategy-.txt ===

First, there were electronic transactions with next business day settlement. Then faster payments arrived, revolutionizing how companies and consumers move money. Now, two instant payment methods push speed and availability even faster: RTP® from The Clearing House® and the upcoming FedNowSM service.  Both platforms can help companies reach domestic DDA accountholders 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year, with irrevocable transactions. RTPs allow payments up to $1 million; FedNow will launch with a $500,000 per-transaction limit.  With so many choices in the market, many treasury professionals are asking, should we deploy RTP now? Or wait until 2023 and adopt FedNow? Which method is best for our disbursement needs? Instead of taking a “wait and see” approach, there’s good reason for businesses to consult with their banks now to make sure you’re maximizing the opportunity presented by instant payment methods. Savvy financial institutions are working side-by-side with payment providers and customers to make using these new methods as seamless as possible.  Gain a competitive advantage with instant payments Instant payment rails like RTP and FedNow empower businesses to send and receive payments within seconds, giving payees almost immediate access to the funds.  This speed and control provides a number of potential benefits: Stronger liquidity management. Instant payments can reduce uncertainty from payment delays and boost working capital, helping businesses strengthen liquidity management and reduce the need for excess cash on hand to cover emergencies or float. Greater customer and supplier satisfaction. No matter who your business pays, reducing the time and effort it takes to receive funds makes a difference. Paying time-sensitive contracts or insurance claims with instant transaction capabilities, for example, can improve your brand experience and even be a competitive differentiator.  Reduced friction across the payment process. Instant payments not only settle faster, they also make invoicing, deposits, posting, and other accounting activities easier. Unlike checks or other payment types, there’s less need for data entry or research to apply payments. “Request for payment” functionality can even eliminate invoicing. Use instant payments when speed, accuracy, and finality matter How will you know which instant payment methods are right for your organization? Start by considering your use cases. Instant payments like FedNow and RTP work best when speed, accuracy, and finality are critical to the transaction.  Early adopters use instant payments for scenarios like these:  Mortgage and lending payoffs at closing Insurance claims settlements to policyholders Emergency payroll and gig employee payouts for the company workforce Merger and acquisition transactions Time-sensitive payments to key suppliers  Next, work with your bank to understand the requirements for issuing instant payments via The Clearing House and the Federal Reserve. Connectivity will be important, as these transactions may require an alternative to daily batch processing.  Payee preference is another factor. Providing your suppliers and customers with options for instant payment can lead to greater satisfaction with your organization. Look for bank tools that help you with payment “decisioning” so you can serve your payees well, without adding extra workload for your team. An instant payments engine lets you send transaction details, while your bank helps manage the process of routing each disbursement through the best instant payments network for your business need.  Lastly, consider the impacts of non-refutable transactions. How will you update your internal treasury management policies and controls, and set appropriate permissions and limits in your systems, so you’re assured your payments reach the correct recipients? Leveraging dual controls, account validation, and other services will help everyone in your company transact with confidence.  Modernize your payments experience In the blink of an eye, it’s now possible to move money safely, efficiently, and conveniently. RTPs and FedNow help your business enjoy these benefits and stay current with the latest instant payment options.

[MUSIC UP]  Wells Fargo Global Treasury Management  Treasury Take  A collection of Global Treasury management videos featuring client business leaders sharing knowledge, experience, insights and strategies.  What it truly means to digitize your organization  The path to digitization  Adam Rigby  Senior lead Digital Product Manager  Wells Fargo Global Treasury Management  Michelle Austin  Chief Financial Officer  Smith Bagley, Inc.  Adam Rigby: Digitizing your organization can take a number of different forms. I am Adam Rigby with Wells Fargo and today I have with me Michelle Austin from Smith Bagley, Inc, the Chief Financial Officer, to talk about what her experience has been like digitizing her organization. Can you talk a little bit about where you are in your company's journey today?  Michelle Austin: Yes, at Smith Bagley, back in 2020, during the pandemic we realized that we really needed a solution to pay our vendors remotely. And so, in 2021 looked and met with a number of different solutions and in 2022 actually implemented a consolidated file process. What that does for us is allows us, our staff, to be 100% remote. We basically take an open payables file and transform that through some help from our MIS department. And that then is uploaded in into the file portal and from there all the payments are done by a third-party vendor. So, it’s been a great solution for us. It’s allowed us, like I said, some efficiencies, in addition to doing something that doesn’t matter if we have staff in the office or not.  Back to Adam: Can you talk a little bit about what it means for your AP team in terms of efficiency because you’ve implemented that change?  Back to Michelle: It’s been great, so our team can work, like I said, 100% remote. I don’t have to worry about having people in the office to get the check stock, sign the checks, stuff the checks, put them in the mail. Saved us some direct costs obviously for all the same reasons, and it’s allowed us really to repurpose that labor. So, we’ve got staff today that used to spend their time doing the very manual tasks that I just described and now they can focus on more important things.  Back to Adam: Thank you Michelle, I appreciate you joining us here today.  Back to Michelle: You’re very welcome.

Michelle is going to talk to us a little bit about what it’s been like at her organization to digitize her business. Michelle, as you’ve been evaluating traditional processes vs digitization options. What have you been weighing in as the pros and cons for the alternatives?  Michelle Austin: Well, what I would like to see for our organization is ultimately, we would have a system for the accounts payable side where we have our invoices come in electronically. We have them processed and sent out remotely to the approvers, and then they come back into our AP system, and that would all be done through AI.  On the receivables side, a similar process where we can do reconciliations electronically and then consolidation of our payment streams.  We receive a number of payments from our customers through various forms and so looking for a way to consolidate all of that through AI on the backend as well, that would be great.  Obviously, the technology has to be balanced with the cost.

=== Contents of com-insights-treasury-insights-treasury-evolving-real-time--.txt ===

By John Hunter, Head of Global Treasury Management Payments and Transaction Services Wells Fargo   The era of “real time” has arrived. Speed has changed our lives dramatically compared to just a few years ago, impacting everything from sending and receiving funds in an instant, to streaming live content, to checking the status of your order with a simple click. “Now” is the new normal; waiting is no longer an option.   Yet in many finance departments it’s still business as usual. Payments, reporting, and liquidity management all rely on the same day-old (or older) data, the same batch processing and manual operations that were “leading edge” more than a decade ago.  Setting a new standard for cash management  If your treasury seems trapped in the past, it’s definitely time to move forward. Instant access to data can revolutionize your company’s financial operations, as well as your customer, supplier, and employee experiences. Considering your options now, as well as involving your bank in planning will ensure you keep pace with the latest developments as they become available.  Innovations in technology make real-time enhancements possible, leveling the playing field for smaller organizations. In the past, only large and sophisticated companies could invest in custom ERP upgrades and system-to-system connectivity. Now, real-time tools like APIs and webhooks, greater adoption of industry standards, and the leadership of key banks are all helping to simplify and democratize real-time access.  New solutions will be scalable for small and medium-sized businesses as well as global enterprises. The result is a new standard for real-time cash management.  7 ways to accelerate progress  Consider opportunities like these for treasury management to put real-time connectivity into practical application.   Imagine making liquidity decisions and mobilizing your cash based on up-to-the-minute balances pulled from accounts at multiple banks. Imagine simplifying your transactions, so each payment uses the method that’s fastest, safest, and most cost-effective.  Imagine making customer service a great experience with automatic notifications and real-time transaction status, all from within your product or mobile app.   There’s even more potential on the horizon as banks and fintechs continue innovating. We’re excited about these seven scenarios: 1. Route your payments efficiently The options for sending and receiving transactions continue to grow, adding complexity and at times, cost. When you have a handful of critical payments, it’s feasible to research the most efficient method (such as wires, Same Day ACH, RTP, or the new FedNow network). But scaling those decisions for larger payment volumes requires substantial information, processing power, and automation.  Enter intelligent routing. With a solution like this, you and your bank will create business rules specific to your priorities, whether you need speed of settlement, lowest processing cost, international reach, or other capabilities. Then, your bank’s payment platform will deploy the best transaction method. The delivery industry already employs this type of tool with great success, letting smart technology recommend the best carrier and delivery timeframe for shipments – so why not do the same with your payments.  2. Detect fraud attempts instantly What if instant access to data could better protect your funds? Your bank, your fraud protection services, and the payment networks you use already collect and monitor thousands of datapoints in real-time. Imagine accessing this sophisticated intelligence to spot potential fraud and misuse before a payment occurs. Real-time connectivity can power this type of solution in the near future. For example, if you’ve never before made a payment in Asia, or if your standard transaction is $5,000 not $50,000, a real-time fraud protection service could detect anomalies and notify your team before you issue the payment. With more irrevocable transactions and real-time settlement, it will be an important safeguard to put on your treasury “must have” list.  3. Reduce your exceptions Who hasn’t been frustrated by the legwork and delays of payment exceptions? Everything from transposed numbers to closed accounts to missing data can strand a payment midstream. Instant connectivity has the potential to alleviate this situation.  In this scenario, instead of sending a batch file for next-day transmission (or printing and mailing checks), imagine technology that can evaluate immediately if payments are complete and accounts are valid—even repairing minor discrepancies automatically. Real-time communications between payment originators, your bank, and other payment endpoints bring this solution to life. 4. Pay non-traditional endpoints Digital wallets bring speed and convenience to consumers, who are adopting them in record numbers. Yet as more companies add branded wallets to their product or service, they’re realizing the right back-office platforms are critical to success.  Rather than adding another vendor to manage, imagine working directly through your bank to establish the real-time connectivity that powers a custom digital wallet experience. One trusted resource could help you design an intuitive workflow, accept new payment methods, and at the same time, enable the necessary back-office functions such as real-time validation, notifications, and reconciliation. 5. Consolidate your reporting When your operations span multiple divisions, countries, currencies, and banks, activities like forecasting and daily cash positioning become arduous. What if, instead of logging into various bank portals, downloading information, and updating complicated spreadsheets, you could find the data you need in a single location?  Consolidated multi-bank real-time reporting is becoming a reality now available, thanks to API connectivity between systems, a push for open banking standards, and comprehensive dashboards. This innovation arms treasury management with sophisticated and up-to-the-minute intelligence across your cash footprint. Staff spend their valuable time evaluating options rather than searching for details.  6. Use your money wisely In rising rate environments, how you manage your liquidity takes on extra significance. But, identifying excess working capital and making smart investment decisions means fast access to data. It’s especially critical for organizations that do business internationally, with cash spread out in accounts worldwide.  APIs and real-time tools can vastly improve your visibility and accelerate your cash flow velocity. Working capital solutions like notional pooling, for example, let you automate and mobilize your excess cash more easily than ever; you can centralize cash management without actually comingling funds or making intercompany loans. Instant access to balances and pending transactions can create other advantages. With real-time solutions, you can make confident decisions in where to spend, where to invest, and how to best use your funds to achieve your business goals.  7. Empower customer service Who hasn’t wondered about the status of an order or when an important payment will arrive? It’s not just a question that finance struggles to answer—employees want to track expense reimbursements; customers and suppliers need accurate data to manage their own balance sheets and update their stakeholders. Real-time access to banking data will be able to supercharge your customer service. Instead of lengthy phone calls or strings of emails, imagine completing payment-related activities directly from your customer-facing mobile app, website, or product. With embedded commerce, you can design the workflow; your bank can supply the data to support your full order-to-cash lifecycle. Make instant data access a priority for treasury Instant access to financial data can accelerate operations, improve decision-making, and increase productivity. It brings benefits that extend far beyond treasury management, to senior leadership, valued customers, and trading partners. There’s no better time than now to talk with your bank about adding real-time capabilities.

Account takeover fraud occurs when a fraudster obtains confidential information – including user IDs, passwords, PINs, and token codes – and uses it to access online banking accounts, transfer funds, or commit other fraudulent acts. Fraudsters gain access by tricking you to divulge your online banking credentials or installing malicious software (malware) on your devices. Download our checklist (PDF) to help reduce your risk of account takeover fraud.

If you’re a B2C business, creating a modern billing and payment experience can reach valuable customers and set your company apart. Younger buyers, in particular, consider flexible payment options and convenient digital tools as “table stakes” when choosing their preferred providers.  One-quarter of Millennials, for example, report prioritizing for payment those bills “with the least payment friction.” Another study notes that when given the option, 60 percent of consumers have used a digital wallet (such as  Apple Pay or Google Pay) to pay their bills, attracted by the ability to “pay instantly.” Cash and checks are also in flux as more consumers opt for cards or digital methods. Six in 10 Americans now expect to see a cashless society in their lifetimes. How to stay current with B2C expectations Given all the options, moving your consumer receivables forward can seem overwhelming. Where should you start? Which payment methods should you accept? How can you offer consumers more choices, while at the same time, keep your processing costs and accounts receivable (AR) workload under control? A step-by-step approach will make the process manageable.  Step 1: Make digital-first a priority Before making any changes, look at your customer base and get a better understanding of how and when they want to pay you. Consider also your business model.   Are you a “receipt-only” business where purchase and payment occur simultaneously, such as a coffee shop, an auto repair facility, an online bookstore, or an e-ticketing site?  Or, are you a “receivables” business like a dentist’s office, insurance company, or utility that needs to issue regular invoices, creating a longer and more complicated consumer collection cycle?   Once you know more about your target audience and their payment preferences, you can choose the right electronic payment options. Security and ease of use will be two important criteria so you can make digital payment convenient for consumers, without adding fraud or other risks to your business practices.  Step 2: Streamline your AR workload Adding new billing and payment options is not without its challenges, especially when B2C companies work with numerous payment providers. It can be difficult to create a streamlined and cost-effective solution across many vendors and systems.  As your business invests in electronic billing and payments, involve your bank in an open dialogue about your receivables goals and challenges. Many times, simple changes can make a big impact for AR teams and your bottom line.  For example, if you’re a receivables business that issues customer bills, make sure you’re using digital invoices with a “pay now” button. Your bank can host the electronic payment options of your choice on a secure website that’s branded to your business. A “pay now” feature can significantly increase payment speed and reduce the hassle of accepting checks.  If your customers pay through online bill pay sites, you can optimize your cash flow and increase straight-through processing with a bank-hosted electronic lockbox, or “eBox.” This service aggregates and standardizes all the digital payments you receive through online bill pay sites. Instead of checks and missing information from these third-parties, you receive electronic deposits and consolidated posting files with the account and invoice numbers you need. Step 3: Keep modernizing The consumer payment landscape continues to evolve, as do customer expectations. Fortunately, payment billing and innovations are keeping pace. Savvy B2C businesses are keeping tabs on solutions such as buy now, pay later (BNPL) short-term financing at point-of-sale, faster payment options like the FedNow service, and new ways to integrate mobile devices into the B2C purchase experience. Consumers appear ready to take invoicing and payments by SMS text messaging into the mainstream. They recognize that a text or email reminding them a bill is due makes it easier to pay on time. They also value “pay now” links embedded in reminder messages which make it easier to complete an online payment.   These and other payment innovations give B2C companies a range of ways to satisfy consumers, optimize your cash conversion cycle, and differentiate your business. Your bank can help you navigate the options and choose the solutions that best meet your specific needs.

Helping you streamline online bill payment processing  Initiating bill payments through a single, trusted banking site may be convenient, simple, and paperless for your customers, but the convenience enjoyed by consumers as they schedule their payments online does not always proceed through the Bill Service Provider (BSP) to the Biller. This is due to the fact that many payments, initially submitted online, still end up being mailed out as paper checks by the BSP. These check-only payments create exceptions and often have incomplete or inaccurate remittance details, which can result in further processing delays. The Wells Fargo E-Box® service is a comprehensive solution, enabling you to manage your online remittance process in a consolidated electronic data stream. With flexible multi-step validation and exception handling options, the E-Box service helps you maximize your straight-through electronic processing rate and minimize your exceptions.  Extensive connectivity to major originating endpoints  Wells Fargo connects to all major originating endpoints, including our extensive network of third-party concentrators, to help you maximize your electronic payments. Leverage the experience of our dedicated E-Box staff in working with billers from multiple industries, including energy and power, financial services, media and telecommunications, the public sector, and originators to implement an efficient electronic receivables solution.  The Wells Fargo advantage   Consolidated file and settlement. You receive a single remittance file and settlement for all online bill payments.  Select from one or more of our convenient processing windows.  Extensive provider network. Maximize electronic payment volume and reduce paper check payment processed, speeding up delivery time when payments are processed electronically, creating a better customer experience.  Robust account validation. With multi-step validation including account masking format, cross reference database processing and the use of inbound validation files, incorrect billing account data provided by consumers can be corrected automatically.  Efficient exception management. Streamline your staff’s workflow around exception items to enhance process efficiency, improve productivity, and minimize costs. Through E-Box Decisioning on our Commercial Electronic Office® (CEO®) portal, you can view, research, and return completed transaction, make decisions on pending transactions, and gain access to information for purposes of reporting and trend analysis.

Wells Fargo supports surcharging only for commercial and corporate banking segment merchants whose business-to-business (B2B) transactions represent at least 50% of their total credit card transaction volume.  Surcharging example: A wholesaler charges a 2% surcharge for qualified B2B credit card payments where other forms of payment do not have this fee. Key information about surcharging:  May not exceed the lower of either (a) the maximum rate permitted by each payment network or (b) the actual processing cost. May not be applied to debit cards or prepaid cards. Supported by Visa, Mastercard®, American Express® OptBlue, and Discover®. The lowest surcharge rate must apply to all payment networks. Must be the only cardholder fee charged by the merchant (it can’t be charged in addition to a service fee). State laws may vary, so it’s important to consult your legal counsel to determine your obligations and if fees are regulated or prohibited before implementing any cardholder fee.

We’ll then work closely with your treasury team and department stakeholders to consolidate payments technologies and streamline the cash application process.  Service fees can help reduce or eliminate the cost of accepting card payments A service fee is a variable or a flat fee that may be applied to debit card and credit card transactions through any payment channel.  Service fee example: A city government agency charges a 2% service fee to pay for building permits with a debit card or credit card instead of a check or another form of payment.

Business-to-business
Efficiently offer electronic B2B payment options Employing the right tools to support B2B transactions can optimize cost and efficiency. Whether you are looking to reduce Days Sales Outstanding (DSO), streamline payments acceptance, enhance data security, or increase customer satisfaction, our Merchant Services consultants specializing in B2B solutions can provide guidance and solutions. Help offset the cost of card processing with surcharging A surcharge is a percent fee that may be applied only to credit card transactions. Wells Fargo supports surcharging only for commercial and corporate banking segment merchants whose business-to-business (B2B) transactions represent at least 50% of their total credit card transaction volume.  Surcharging example: A wholesaler charges a 2% surcharge for qualified B2B credit card payments where other forms of payment do not have this fee. Key information about surcharging:  May not exceed the lower of either (a) the maximum rate permitted by each payment network or (b) the actual processing cost. May not be applied to debit cards or prepaid cards. Supported by Visa, Mastercard®, American Express® OptBlue, and Discover®. The lowest surcharge rate must apply to all payment networks. Must be the only cardholder fee charged by the merchant (it can’t be charged in addition to a service fee). State laws may vary, so it’s important to consult your legal counsel to determine your obligations and if fees are regulated or prohibited before implementing any cardholder fee.

Overview

Reports




We’re creating smarter ways for U.S.-based companies and their subsidiaries to manage their global business. With Wells Fargo helping with your international treasury strategy, you’ll have the advantage of one banking relationship that offers both U.S. and in-region implementation and technical support. We can help you strengthen your relationships with your overseas employees, customers, and vendors because you’ll transact with them in currencies that best meet your needs and theirs. Our electronic payment and reporting services are available using one online platform with robust security, our Commercial Electronic Office® (CEO®) portal. You can also use CEO Mobile®, as available in a geographic region, to monitor your accounts, approve transactions, and receive reporting on the go. We offer: Simplified cash management  Manage your Wells Fargo accounts online — CEO connects your offices, operations, and subsidiaries so you can work conveniently and efficiently. Potentially accelerate your cash flow from foreign receivables — make and collect payments in region. Increase visibility into your global cash position — on one single sign-on platform you’ll have end of day and intraday reporting in the same formats for all your Wells Fargo accounts and accounts you hold with other banks.  Easier transactions  Transact throughout the world in multiple currencies — you’ll settle to accounts in those currencies. Where you have receivables that match your required payables currencies, pay your trading partners and others without converting one currency to another — you’ll potentially reduce your foreign exchange cost.  For more resources and insights, read Business Viewpoints.


Our global accounts can help you manage your international operating flows in ways very similar to your day-to-day U.S. treasury activities. You can keep your familiar Wells Fargo banking relationships, customer service, and online access, so that you achieve the simplicity you want. U.S. Foreign Currency Accounts If you’re concerned about foreign exchange risk or the additional due diligence of overseas bank accounts, then a Wells Fargo U.S. Foreign Currency Account may be your best solution. We offer 28 currencies. Because you transact in the account’s currency, you can make outbound wire payments and deposit wire receivables without foreign exchange transaction costs. Because you hold these accounts in the U.S., you no longer need to prepare Foreign Bank Account Reporting (FBAR). Moreover, these accounts are eligible for Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) insurance. How it works  You open an account using a process similar to opening a U.S. demand deposit account. You send wire payments securely cross border from the U.S. using the same channel you use for your U.S. dollar (USD) accounts: CEO® Wires, Foreign Exchange on CEO®, Payment Manager®, or SWIFT services. You receive incoming wire transfers from around the world and incoming book transfers from your other U.S. Wells Fargo accounts. You optionally manage your cash — and cover overdrafts — by establishing a zero or target balance structure so that cash balances move automatically to a parent account.  Accounts for Canada Our in-country international bank accounts in USD and Canadian dollar give you the ability to send and receive electronic payments within Canada and cross border.,  They’re the basis of our Canadian treasury management solutions. Accounts for the U.K., Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA) With choices for British pound (GBP), Euro (EUR), and USD as well as 17 other currencies, a U.K. branch account lets you make non-urgent (Bacs), GBP Faster Payments, and urgent high-value GBP payables and receivables. In addition, approximately 600 partner bank branches throughout the U.K. provide over-the-counter services. You can also initiate and receive same day EUR payments throughout Europe. For non-urgent payments, you can take advantage of the simplified payment format for Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) for both payables and receivables. These accounts are the basis of our EMEA treasury management solutions.


With cross-border and in-country options, you can flexibly make and collect international payments.  Global ACH — With a U.S. USD account, you can send repetitive, non-urgent batch payments (ACH credits) in nine currencies using our Global ACH service. With a U.K. branch account, you can use the same online service to send ACH credits in 11 currencies, so that you can reach more than 40 countries and territories. Beneficiaries receive electronic payments typically within two to five business days. Wire transfers — You can send and receive wires conveniently using the initiation option that suits your needs: online, consolidated payables, SWIFT, or (in the U.S.) application programming interface (API). Payment Manager® — You can streamline your global payments process by sending one file with multiple payment types and related remittance information. This consolidated payables service lets you send files from your internal system. We separate the payments by type and then process them accordingly. By reducing the use of paper documents and manual data entry, you can potentially minimize mistakes and increase efficiency. Foreign Exchange on CEO® — You can send foreign exchange wires 24 hours a day, six days a week online that settle to your commercial accounts. You’ll benefit from live market rates for more than 120 currencies. If you need to generate an audit trail, you can debit a foreign draft with your Wells Fargo USD account and then print it from your location. SWIFT — You can streamline your back office by routing all payments and other transactions to Wells Fargo through SWIFT, a reliable connectivity channel. With request for transfer functionality, you can move money out of non-Wells Fargo accounts, giving you the benefit of concentrating funds.  The following two services help U.S.-based companies receive payments from individuals and entities located outside of the U.S. Global Invoice Connect® Our Global Invoice Connect with TransferMate® service — an inbound payments solution for you — can give your customers in more than 60 countries and territories a convenient electronic payment option in more than 35 currencies. Our service provider provides electronic bill presentment in USD or in your customers’ local currencies and then collects your funds direct to your U.S. USD account. You always receive your full invoiced amount, no matter how your customers pay. Global Check Clearing Through our direct relationships with foreign correspondent banks, combined with high-volume processing, we’re able to offer a cost-effective way to clear checks in a variety of foreign currencies or drawn on foreign banks in eligible countries. Depending on your current method of handling foreign check payments, your funds availability timing may improve.


Our reporting services on CEO® help you can gain insight and control over your global cash picture. Through this secure single sign-on portal, you view details of your pending and posted transactions from a browser on your desktop or mobile device. Additionally, CEO Mobile®, available in select geographic regions, gives you access to reporting on the go. You can alternatively obtain treasury reports by API, Direct BAI, SWIFT, and ISO 20022 channels. Treasury Information Reporting Our Treasury Information Reporting service on CEO delivers previous day composite and intraday composite reports with comprehensive balance, summary, and transaction details. We also provide reporting specific to electronic payment transactions. You can view and download reports for use in your accounting, treasury workstation, enterprise resource planning (ERP), or system of record.

IBAN stands for International Bank Account Number. It identifies an individual account, at a specific financial institution, in a particular country and is used to process financial transactions between institutions in different countries. Used correctly, the IBAN facilitates faster payment processing. Refer to the IBAN registry (PDF) for a list of countries that require IBANs and each country’s unique IBAN format. SWIFT (Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication) is the official IBAN registrar.



IBAN Format


Using IBAN


SWIFT BIC




The IBAN model creates a standard for account numbering among multiple countries. The model requires certain components to be present in all IBANs, but also allows for some flexibility for country-specific requirements. By adding components to existing account numbers, the IBAN improves a bank’s ability to process cross-border payments without having to manually repair transactions or replace existing account numbers. If you do not use the IBAN in countries that require its use, your payments might be returned without processing. An IBAN consists of up to 34 alphanumeric characters, which include the following:   Country code  – the ISO (International Organization for Standardization) country code   Check digits  – two check digits provided by the issuing financial institution based on a calculation that takes into account the entire IBAN   Bank identifier  – code that identifies the financial institution and, when appropriate, the branch of that financial institution servicing an account   Basic bank account number (BBAN)  – code that identifies an individual account, at a specific financial institution, in a particular country   Sample IBAN Format         Country Code Check Digits Bank Identifier Basic Bank Account Number (BBAN)     GB 76 PNBP 165671 12345678    Refer to the IBAN registry (PDF) for a list of countries that require IBANs and each country’s unique IBAN format.


When preparing your transaction:  Insert the IBAN in the account number field on any forms or screens used to create the payment Do not use both the account number and the IBAN. Remitters sometimes mistakenly insert the account number in the account number field and the IBAN in the bank-to-bank reference field or the OBI (Originating Beneficiary Information) field. Doing so will cause the payment to stop for repair at the beneficiary bank, negating the purpose of the IBAN. Instead, simply place the IBAN, which includes the account number, in the account number field. Include both the beneficiary’s IBAN and SWIFT BIC when making international payments destined for countries that participate in the IBAN registry (see “SWIFT BIC” tab). 


SWIFT BICs (business identifier codes), which are often called SWIFT codes, are a series of either eight or 11 alphanumeric characters that help to identify a specific financial institution. The number includes a bank code, a country code, a location code, and an optional branch code. Sample BIC         Bank Code Country Code Location Code Branch Code     PNBP GB 2L XXX (Represents the head office location)    Including an IBAN and a SWIFT BIC in wire instructions potentially will keep your wire fees lower because financial institutions in the beneficiary’s country may choose to either charge an additional fee for, or return, wires that do not include these numbers. Refer to our international resources for more information on SWIFT BIC numbers and other payment directories. Learn more about SWIFT.

Despite frequent fraud attempts, many businesses do not suffer financial losses because they implement strong fraud protection strategies. Is your organization protected?

Check fraud
Checks continue to be the payment method most often exposed to fraudulent activity. If your company writes checks or maintains checking accounts, we recommend you review the following services to ensure all your checking accounts have the fraud prevention and detection services for your company:  Positive Pay systematically compares checks presented for payment to your issued-check files to detect serial numbers and dollar amounts that don’t match. Payee validation identifies payee names that do not match the payee name information sent on your check issue files. Reverse Positive Pay is an alternative to positive pay services for companies unable to transmit issued-check files to Wells Fargo. You get the opportunity to review checks presented for payment and determine if they should be paid or returned. Payment Authorization enables you to place controls on your accounts that help to prevent fraudulent activity, specifically unauthorized checks and over the counter debits. 


ACH fraud
If you make ACH payments, these services can help protect you:   Wells Fargo ACH Fraud Filter – The "Stop" service automatically stops all ACH debits – except those you specifically pre-authorize – from posting to your accounts. The "Review" service presents transactions to you for pay or return decisions.     Perfect Receivables® service – If your company has a high volume of electronic receivables, reduce the risk that your account number will fall into the wrong hands. The  Perfect Receivables  service protects your account by providing "proxy" account numbers for your customers to use when remitting ACH and wire payments to you.  





Report Fraud
Act fast and follow these important steps immediately if you think you or your company might be the victim of a fraud or attempted fraud.

=== Contents of com-insights-treasury-insights-3-essentials-strengthen-cyber-security-.txt ===

 For CFOs and treasury professionals, sleepless nights are nothing new, especially when it comes to cyber risk management. Sophisticated new threats emerge constantly, each with the potential to disrupt company payments, communications, or operations. Ransomware, denial of service attacks, and business email compromise are just a few of the popular tactics in use today. Establishing a mature cyber security program helps provide robust protection from these and other issues so finance can fulfill its mission. While the information or cyber security teams typically spearhead such an initiative, treasury management can play a critical role.  The strongest cyber security programs align with overall business strategy, creating a unified approach for assessing risk across the business. For treasury, it starts with open dialog to understanding how finance systems, processes, and payments fit into your company’s overall cyber defenses.  Strive for top-down support and cross-functional participation As you dive into cybersecurity, you may hear the phrase “cyber everywhere,” which refers to the ubiquitous nature of cyber threats in today’s complex and digitally connected world. An effective and mature cyber program should encompass a layered security environment of people, processes, and technology. This approach will aggressively and continually mitigate risk and enable you to build capabilities for future protection. Mature cyber security programs focus on security, vigilance, and resilience:  Security — Implementing policies, procedures, and cyber strategies to prevent and detect threats.  Vigilance — Rapidly detecting threats and attacks.  Resilience — Responding and recovering from attacks to restore business operations.  Visible, top-down support is another hallmark. Active involvement by senior leaders emphasizes the importance of cyber security to employees at levels and across all lines of business. Evolve your cyber maturity in these three areas Developing a mature cyber security program means taking a systematic and proactive approach to counteract potential threats. Here are three areas where treasury management can support your company’s efforts and help move your program forward.   Identify and detect threats   When you know the issues most likely to impact your business, it becomes easier to deploy the right protections. A mature cyber security program continually assesses risk factors, then develops processes to monitor and detect potential issues. With today’s interconnected landscape, your lens needs to look beyond internal systems, processes, and people; risk assessments and protections also need to flow through your vendors and supply chain.   Treasury can support your company efforts by sharing knowledge from your bank and payment providers and making sure finance staff understand their role in maintaining a secure environment. Assess organizational readiness   Once you’ve identified potential risks, your company can start to transform systems and processes to better defend your organization. Cross-functional planning sessions and tabletop exercises are two ways to assess your readiness, find gaps, and document resources. Treasury management should be a key participant when exploring any payment-related scenarios.  Respond and recover quickly   The final step toward cyber maturity establishes business continuity plans that indicate how you’ll manage daily operations if a cyber issue does occur. These may include setting up parallel system or processes, identifying critical communications, or testing alternative options with banks, vendors, and other providers. Advance preparation will help you respond and recover quickly.  Continually monitor and improve Just as cyber threats continually evolve, so should your company’s cyber security program. Achieving “maturity” is a continual journey without a clear finish line. However, the more your organization works together to assess and improve, the more resilience your company develops to keep pace with current and future risk factors.

Wedded to spreadsheets and manual data entry? Enjoying the grind of month-end close on day seven? Thrilled at the latest forecast that’s outdated by the time it’s built?  Few treasury professionals would say “yes” to these scenarios. It’s why automation projects are proliferating across finance. There are faster, better ways to work. However, getting corporate stakeholders to invest in treasury projects can be a tough sell. After all, the traditional view holds that accounts payable and receivable are cost centers, not profit-makers.  APIs are game-changers for treasury automation That perception is changing, especially as more businesses realize the competitive advantages that speed, accuracy, and automation can bring. It makes getting your treasury automation project on the corporate To Do list feasible—particularly when you advocate for new solutions that make it faster, easier, and less expensive to update systems, compared to lengthy custom development cycles.  APIs are one of these game-changers.  APIs are prebuilt connections that link company systems (such as an ERP, treasury workstation, mobile app, or payment website) directly to bank products and services, for “always on” exchange of information. Unlike batch processing that happens at set timeframes, or portals and file transfers that require user intervention, APIs move information automatically. The result is instant access to banking information, payments, and other services—without downloading files, waiting for reports, or re-entering data between systems.  How to get traction for your API project To get your API initiative on the radar, along with appropriate funding and IT resources,  build your business case with these three steps.  1. Think big First, start by envisioning what success looks like. Document your current systems and processes, then identify the friction points that impede efficiency, accuracy, or customer service.  Look for opportunities such as:  When do you re-enter data? Where do you use multiple systems to complete an activity? How is the current process impacting staff productivity, corporate decision-making, or customer experience?  This is the time to dream big. Ask for input from a variety of roles, from those who “do” the day-to-day work (such as treasury analysts and frontline accounts payable and receivable clerks) to those who make strategic decisions (such as the head of finance). Involve your bank for perspectives from similar organizations and those outside your industry.  2. Start small Next, prioritize your efforts. Take the big picture opportunities from step one and find small yet high value projects that you can complete quickly and easily, with measurable results. The goal is to show stakeholders the value of automation within a few weeks or months, so you can gain credibility, build traction, and continue funding across multiple budget cycles.  Consider the feasibility of API projects like these:  Automating reconciliation with real-time access to balances and transaction details Streamlining vendor payments with instant confirmation that bank accounts are open and valid Implementing a faster payment method for immediate payment needs, such as contractor reimbursements  Once you’ve narrowed your options, invite your bank and your IT team to the table. Review available APIs and develop requirements specific to your use cases and internal systems.  Most importantly, quantify your projected efficiency gains from automating your treasury processes. Depending on the maturity of your company and your business model, this could include supporting rapid growth without needing to hire new staff, or improving productivity to reallocate existing team members to higher value activities.  3. Learn fast To close your business case, focus on timing. APIs are significantly faster to deploy—and easier to learn and use—compared to buying and training users on new systems, or investing in file transfer capabilities. Work with your project team, IT department, and your bank to find a first project that gets you up-and-running quickly. Demonstrate in your business case how you’ll track improvements, measure ROI, and document future opportunities. Stakeholders will appreciate knowing how you’ll apply your learnings to future endeavors and use their corporate support wisely.  Create momentum beyond a single API project Whether you’re looking to expedite payments, receivables, or reconciliation, or simply to mitigate risk by avoiding manual data entry, the benefits of APIs will be immediate and quantifiable. Using a “think big, start small, learn fast” approach will ensure your automation journey starts strong and maintains momentum for years to come.

The swivel.  If you work in a finance function, you’re familiar with it. It’s the endless movement between multiple screens and applications, “swiveling” back and forth to gather information, manually re-enter data, and complete your daily work.  Finally, the end of the swivel is in sight. Companies of all sizes are automating these routine activities with powerful APIs. They’re accelerating access to information, vastly improving efficiency, and making real-time treasury a reality.  Making real-time treasury possible  Just what is real-time treasury? It’s more than a corporate buzzword; it’s the next horizon for finance. Instead of relying on batch processing and next-day timeframes, real-time treasury delivers data as it happens, directly into company systems. It arms stakeholders with the insights needed for strategic decision-making in real time and simplifies the workload for frontline staff.  APIs are central to achieving real-time treasury. These machine-to-machine interfaces relay information with lightning-fast speeds and with “always on” connectivity. Unlike batch processing that happens at set timeframes, or portals and file transfers that require user intervention, APIs move information automatically.  APIs are not new, but they are seeing mainstream adoption. (Wells Fargo introduced our first APIs and our developer gateway in 2016; we now offer more than 40 proven APIs.)  One of the reasons behind the groundswell—particularly at mid-market companies—is the ease of use that APIs offer. With their “plug and play” functionality, APIs require far less time, effort, and IT resources to implement compared to custom development. They’re equally seamless for users, who find the data they need at their fingertips, without cumbersome swiveling between platforms and portals.  Creating value for staff, customers, and suppliers  APIs bring numerous advantages. Employing these system-to-system connections to your bank can help companies:   Do business more easily. APIs reduce the number of steps and systems it takes to accomplish your goals. Employees can work more productively or redeploy their time to higher value activities compared to downloading files and entering data.  Operate in real-time. Instead of waiting minutes, hours, or even days to obtain transaction data, APIs enable instant, “always on” access to critical information. You can spend more time making decisions and less time hunting for data.  Maximize your investment. Using pre-developed and proven functionality can eliminate weeks and even months from your development cycle. APIs work with most systems that treasury already uses, helping you improve ROI and reduce development costs.  Reduce your risk. APIs deliver up-to-the-minute information, making it possible to settle payments instantly, reconcile transactions daily, and spot fraud attempts quickly. In addition, leveraging APIs from regulated financial institutions safeguards your all-important data by ensuring you integrate with secure and compliant endpoints.  Enhance your customer experience. APIs can help you meet—and exceed—the high expectations that customers, suppliers, and employees bring to their daily activities. The flexibility of APIs and numerous pre-developed options let you identify use cases and create the ideal workflow that meets your needs.   API use cases meet broad range of finance needs  Leading banks offer a range of prebuilt APIs designed to facilitate everything from immediate balance inquiries to transacting faster payments to reconciling in real-time. Ongoing customer feedback and collaboration mean new automation options come to market regularly.  Some of the most popular treasury management APIs include:   Instant visibility into available cash balances  Consolidated multi-bank reporting to streamline cash forecasting  Automated posting to your general ledger or client accounts  Issuing and receiving a variety of faster payments, including Same Day ACH, RTPs, and FedNow   Innovative financial institutions also offer APIs that support broader financial activities. These include solutions for working capital management in the capital markets, and ways for organizations with inventory financing to manage approvals and invoices related to their commercial lines of credit. All benefit from the swift and automated exchange of information.  More options, more automation for treasury The evolution of APIs doesn’t end there. Leading banks are working with ERP providers to develop even smarter API functionality that will deliver the data treasury management needs directly into your system-of-record—without extensive IT resources. These “embedded banking” solutions will maximize convenience and simplify implementation.  APIs offer impressive opportunity for businesses to streamline their banking activities and move real-time treasury from vision to reality. Best of all, they signal an end to the “treasury swivel” and a new way to automate, optimize, and use your team’s talents effectively.

Transcript: Treasury Take: Balancing digital change

[MUSIC UP] Wells Fargo Global Treasury Management Treasury Take A collection of Global Treasury management videos featuring client business leaders sharing knowledge, experience, insights and strategies. What it truly means to digitize your organization Balancing digital changes Adam Rigby  Senior lead Digital Product Manager  Wells Fargo Global Treasury Management Michelle Austin  Chief Financial Officer  Smith Bagley, Inc. Adam Rigby: Digitizing your organization can take a number of different forms. I am Adam Rigby with Wells Fargo and today I have with me Michelle Austin from Smith Bagley, Inc., the Chief Financial Officer, to talk about what her experience has been like digitizing her organization. Michelle, a host of internal and external factors can impact when you make a decision for your organization. Can you talk about what it means to choose between an incremental or transformational change for your business? Michelle Austin: For Smith Bagley, we really haven’t made any transformational changes yet, I think our changes so far have been, you know we’re just getting our feet wet into the digitization and our changes have been minimal. We’ve been able to really offset any costs with some minor changes elsewhere. So, I think, down the road, now that we’re on this path, it’s a great path for us, and I think we’ll be looking for additional changes going forward.  Back to Adam: So, you mentioned costs, can you talk a little about the cost analysis you do when you’re deciding between if I should make a change or stay with the status quo? Back to Michelle: So, within Smith Bagley costs, we don’t have a set aside budget, necessarily, for this digitization in our company. However, what we look at is in terms of efficiencies. So, with the changes, even with the simple ones we’ve made today, we have actually realized some direct cost benefits and time savings benefits. As a small company you know we not able to reduce head count but what we have been able to do is reallocate labor proportionately. Back to Adam: Thank you Michelle, I appreciate you joining us here today. Back to Michelle: You’re very welcome, thanks for having me.

 Criminals thrive on opportunity. They look for weaknesses in systems or processes, then exploit them. When they find a scheme that works, they often deploy it against numerous companies.  Cyber-attacks that follow this pattern appear regularly. Often, threat actors systematically target a specific industry or type of business, wreaking havoc across a single sector. Recent ransomware incidents in the healthcare and services industries such as LockBit offer a prime example.  One way to protect your business is by updating your playbook with a community approach to cyber security.  Expand cyber security beyond your company walls Many businesses have strong internal programs to monitor, detect, and prevent cyber threats. These typically include protocols for company systems, employees, and processes. Communication is also critical. The information security or IT team develops ways to assess risk and share necessary information with company leaders and frontline employee.  Taking cyber security beyond your company walls can arm your business with an additional layer of protection. It may seem counter-intuitive but collaborating with others in your industry or geographic market (and even your competitors) can provide a number of benefits. These advantages include:  Obtaining vital early awareness on new and emerging cyber threats Learning best practices and techniques to improve security Keeping up with new and pending legislation   Invite public and private sector participants Building your community means developing relationships with cyber security professionals outside your company. At first, it may seem strange to work toward a common goal with leaders from other companies. But the more you can find areas of cooperation, the greater the benefit to all involved.  Transparent conversations about what you are seeing or experiencing are key. It also helps to realize that every company will have its own approach to cyber security, and its own tolerance for risk. More sophisticated organizations will likely be more active in monitoring and detecting potential threats, as well as educating others on tactics and best practices.  An effective industry-wide coalition typically includes:  Private sector businesses of all sizes Trade associations Legislative and governing bodies at state and national levels Critical vendors and supply chain resources  Your business still needs an internal cyber security program. However, working together with industry peers helps increase vigilance and resilience for all involved. Industry-wide communication can provide significant muscle to deter threat actors, reduce the impact of cyber-attacks, and decrease risk.

By John Hunter, Head of Global Treasury Management Payments and Transaction Services Wells FargoFor companies large and small, real-time speed and efficiency have arrived. Customers and stakeholders now expect immediate access to information, near-instant transactions, and all from the convenience of their preferred device or system.  Creating the treasury infrastructure to make real-time a reality is more valuable than ever. That’s because back-office functions like cash application, supplier payments, forecasting, and reporting now play a bigger, more vital role in a company’s overall brand and customer experience. It’s why more organizations are working proactively with their bank to develop synergies between their treasury platforms, their payment methods, and their core business functions. Too often, however, technology is the only consideration when companies plan a move from batch processing and legacy tools to the new capabilities available with APIs, webhooks, and other real-time solutions.  It’s just as important to fundamentally evolve your treasury processes, skills, and controls. Only with a shift in perspective will you truly maximize the opportunities that real-time solutions present. Future-proof your business with real-time capabilities Innovative real-time capabilities now span a range of functions, from real-time payments to multi-bank dashboards to automated notifications. It’s an exciting time, with leading banks, fintechs, ERP providers, and other players all unveiling new solutions regularly.  Adopting one or more of these capabilities now (and developing a roadmap for future solutions) helps your organization “future-proof” so you can fully support your customers, internal stakeholders, and key business partners.  Other benefits of real-time treasury solutions include:  Automating routine and redundant activities Attracting and retaining key talent Working efficiently and productively Making stronger business decisions, especially around liquidity Creating a competitive advantage in the market  As your organization crafts its real-time strategy, it’s important to realize the impacts of automation, speed, and visibility to your treasury processes and team. Rethinking the following three elements will set your organization up for success.  1. Rethink your processes Real-time operations dramatically accelerate the speed at which treasury operates. APIs help you replace batch processing, intraday or next-day reporting, and painstaking downloads of data with real-time transactions and instant access to information. Instead of swiveling between numerous platforms, spreadsheets, and portals, you can embed key functionality within your core back-office system—or even your customer-facing applications.  The switch to real-time means rethinking your processes. For example:  What does faster access to information and greater automation mean for staff who apply cash or do cash flow forecasting?  What risk management checkpoints, approvals, and controls need to change in order to safeguard company funds and data in a real-time environment?  How will working capital and liquidity management processes improve? How will your cash application processes change to accommodate real-time payments received on weekends or holidays?  Looking at these and other work flows can help you apply real-time treasury across your customer, supplier, and employee experiences.  2. Rethink your skills Historically, working in finance meant building out spreadsheets, moving data between systems, and even manual activities like printing and mailing customer invoices. Treasury management, accounts receivable, and accounts payable all hired team members versed in these routine tasks.  Now, there’s far more automation. As your organization adopts new solutions, it’s smart to rethink the skillsets you need and how you can redeploy your staff. With current, accurate information at your fingertips, there’s a greater need for those fluent in critical thinking, financial analysis, managing technology, and interpreting data; those who manually process payments, print checks, and reconcile accounts may need upskilling and education for the future.  3. Rethink your technology How your company manages systems is the final area to rethink. Fortunately, APIs and other real-time tools require fewer IT resources and far less investment, compared to custom development efforts of the past. That puts real-time within reach of small and large organizations alike.  It also expands the reach of treasury solutions. Real-time brings treasury beyond the back-office operations and into sales, customer service, and even product development. Rethinking your technology means taking a big picture approach, strengthening relationships across the organization, and working with the right external resources who can bring your business goals to life.  Minimize complexity by working with trusted providers Your bank can play a vital role in your transformation to real-time. You can minimize complexity by working through a few trusted resources rather than sourcing solutions from numerous, disconnected vendors. You can also transact with confidence, especially as more real-time transactions settle with irrevocable terms. It’s vital to safeguard both your data and funds at all points; your financial institution understands and adheres to strict regulations, with powerful fraud-fighting tools. Your bank can even operate as the “connective tissue” that links you to various payment networks, digital wallets, and other innovations that will streamline your workload and power your customer experiences.

Impostor fraud, also known as business email compromise (BEC), occurs when a criminal impersonates someone you know and trust such as a vendor, executive, or the IRS. The impostor contacts you by phone, email, fax, or postal mail and submits an invoice or requests a payment or a change to vendor payment instructions. This results in your payment going to the fraudster rather than where you intended. Unlike other types of fraud, impostor fraud is difficult to detect because the transactions made on your account are consistent with regular payments and are made by authorized personnel. Always verify sensitive requests using this checklist to help ensure you don’t miss an important step. Download checklist (PDF)

Kate Lewis, Accounts Receivable Specialist, started her job at Litehouse Inc. at the right time. Just weeks before, the food manufacturer launched Integrated Receivables (IR) from Wells Fargo. The sophisticated solution quickly transformed the company’s accounts receivable (AR), fully automating 95 percent of their U.S. cash application.  What often took her predecessor a full day, Lewis now handles in 1-2 hours. Gone are cumbersome spreadsheets, manual data entry, and hours spent tracking down details. Wells Fargo’s flexible IR tool applies the power of artificial intelligence and machine learning to expedite the company’s AR processes.  Bringing scale and efficiency to AR Wendy Gibson, Senior Accountant, manages Litehouse’s AR team. After 24 years with the company, working from their Sandpoint, Idaho, headquarters, she recognizes the scale, efficiency, and benefits that automation creates.  In a typical month, IR now automates the processing of more than $21 million in receivables. In a typical month, IR automates an average of 2,000 invoices per month and corresponding check and electronic payments resulting in significant time savings for the Litehouse Inc. team.  “I saw the IR implementation and I was blown away at how fast and easy it was!” Gibson said. “What used to take a person nearly all day—and sometimes into the next day—now can be done in just the morning hours.” Automation is nothing new to Litehouse. Prior to adding IR, they deployed Wells Fargo’s Payment Manager solution to streamline accounts payable (AP). “It works really well,” Gibson explained. “IR is the same concept, bringing in and matching payments automatically. To add receivables and get efficiencies here has been awesome.” Eliminating spreadsheets, manual work, and all-day effort Founded more than 60 years ago, Litehouse has grown from a local institution to a nationwide powerhouse. Their flagship products include a variety of high-quality salad dressings, dips, and salsas found in grocery stores, cafeterias, and restaurant chains around the country.  Processing the invoices and payments associated with a food service business, however, means nuances not found in other industries. With large customers, for example, a single check can cover dozens or even hundreds of open invoices. Customers also routinely apply discounts to their payments, reflecting everything from early payment to products damaged during delivery.  Unraveling those details required patience and hard work for Litehouse. The company uses a specialized ERP for manufacturers. While the system contains fields for discounts and other notes, the AR team could not apply cash directly in the ERP. First, they needed to match payments and open invoices, then balance each day’s cash in an Excel spreadsheet.  “The old way, you had to type everything into a spreadsheet, make sure everything balanced, and it was very cumbersome and time consuming,” Gibson recalled.  She added, “It used to take all day, and sometimes into the next day. We’d all have to pitch in and get caught up.” Automation reduces aging from millions of dollars to under $500,000 Now, only Canadian payments require a spreadsheet, and Litehouse looks forward to automating them with IR in the future.  Gibson and Lewis cite numerous advantages with IR, from reduced Days Sales Outstanding (DSO) and accelerated collections to greater productivity in the AR team.  “A year ago, our aging was very high—and now our 60-day report has shrunk from a few million dollars to under $500,000,” Gibson said. “Part of that is because Kate can get payments in, then move on to collections faster.” Lewis agrees. Her strength is collections; being able to apply each day’s cash quickly gives her ample time to for outreach to customers and other activities that create a positive impact on the bottom line.  “It’s the time factor,” Lewis explained. “If I had to post everything manually, it would take all day. IR gives me time to do other things—specifically collections and some deductions—without needing another person.” Managing growth without adding FTEs Senior management also appreciates the benefits of IR, especially the savings it creates as the company continues to expand. Litehouse Inc. has grown to include five owned brands and a handful of exciting licensing partners, like California Pizza Kitchen. IR has enabled Litehouse’s small AR team—just four specialists for invoicing, deductions, cash application, and collections—to keep up with the pace and they now have more capacity for other core activities.   “We’re just growing out of sight, but Integrated Receivables has helped us scale our business without needing to hire more  headcount,” Gibson said. “We would have needed another person to do collections if we kept working manually.” Gibson’s pride in their accomplishments comes from being not just the manager of AR, but a stakeholder in Litehouse’s future. The organization is 100% employee-owned, sharing values of integrity, stewardship, accountability, and excellence. Using IR helps them achieve these goals.  She encourages other organizations to make the switch to IR. Her advice?  “I’d tell them get with this century! We’re all looking for new efficiencies, and this is the way to go,” Gibson said. Lewis concurred, adding, “Integrated Receivables makes the process so time efficient—it really has been amazing.”

 FDA approval is a foundational requirement for many products developed by pharmaceutical and other healthcare startups, however a lot more preparation is required for commercial success. To create financial value, it is important that Pharma and Health Tech companies execute a well-orchestrated go-to-market strategy. Unfortunately, many companies, large and small, fail in this process due to both poor preparation and misjudging the complexities of scaling an organization quickly enough to seize the opportunities created by a successful product. Evolving Challenges since COVID-19  It is estimated that at least 90% of all startups fail which is representative of the healthcare market as well: 90% of startups in the healthcare market will fail or be “aqui-hired” (acquiring a company’s talent) within 2-5 years of launching. For Healthcare and Pharma startups, the product itself is rarely the problem: Failure is often the result of an unclear business model, the lack of a clear go-to-market strategy, or a poorly defined value proposition. During the COVID-19 pandemic, many investors looked to the public health and infectious disease space as the next big opportunity, but the obstacles facing these startups were even greater than in other sectors. Not surprisingly, the main challenges which startups usually face include finding customers and securing the investments needed for their innovations. During the pandemic when compared with pre-pandemic data, these challenges increased by 20% and 8% respectively. Post the COVID-19 pandemic, new capital has become increasingly harder to access and even more expensive due to increased risk in a volatile rate environment. While funding is still available, it has become more competitive than ever to gain investors' trust and investments. Venture Capital funds have begun looking more closely at underlying business models, growth strategies, and how successful products will be when launched at scale. Business Planning and Quality Control While influence in the industry and comprehensive business planning can increase the odds of commercial success, there are many circumstances out of our start-up clients’ control, including: the timing of an FDA approval, potential changes in regulation which might not get past the comment period or may require multiple iterations, delays in the next funding rounds, etc. Despite these points of uncertainty, a company can control the quality and efficacy of its business processes and controls, in addition to how it poises itself for success within its specialty. Investors are just as much interested in the efficacy of the product as the foundation and direction of the organization overall. Especially the finance and treasury function can use the time before the FDA approval to get business processes in order and look for opportunities to build out scalable processes. Examples of foundations which should be set early on include Finance and Treasury functions; taking advantage of the timeframe prior to FDA approval will allow a smooth implementation of business processes, thereby allowing for more opportunities to build out scalable processes. Cash flow is another particular financial measure to keep an eye on during periods of growth, especially in circumstances where additional venture funding is slower than in previous years, so paying careful attention to timing of cash flow will pay off now and in the future. By being attentive at the key moments to Treasury and Finance metrics, the growth trajectory of a startup can increase sustainably, keeping the interest of investors. Key infrastructure components which will need to be reviewed and put in place are the ERP system, HR platform, and digital payments ecosystem. Let’s look at each one in more detail and highlight how these relate to the high growth enablement. HR, ERP, and Electronic Payments  The implementation of an HR system to automate the HR related processes and functions of a startup are significant, and can occur either on a standalone basis, or an integrated one within the ERP. When set-up correctly, many HR related functions can be automated such as recruiting and training new employees, hiring, benefits administration, performance management, payroll, and tracking of compliance requirements. Especially in times of accelerated hiring and onboarding of new employees, the HR system needs to be scalable and compliant with the applicable state and federal regulations. ERP and HR applications are held to high cyber security standards are paramount in protecting proprietary and patient data for your startup. Many hosted and cloud-based solutions of HR and ERP systems support pay-as-you go models which reduce the need for an upfront investment and leave the operations of the systems and certain cyber security matters to third party providers. The third component involves setting up electronic payments and receivables processes that integrate with the aforementioned ERP and HR system. To ensure scalability, manual and paper-based processes should be avoided for these responsibilities. Electronic bank statements and commercial card files should be inputted into the ERP automatically to support auto reconciliation and identify exceptions, both of which would identify fraud quickly. If travel is a major requirement, a commercial travel card program will need to be established early on and will also need to support controls that align with policies and avoid sales practice issues. Pricing and Billing Models It is also important to think about different pricing and billing models early on which will need to be supported as part of the go-to-market strategy. Flexibility of the billing platform and integration into the Account Receivables process will be important in reducing lost revenue and in avoiding granting unwarranted discounts. Once a new product is on the market questions arise such as:    How will orders be created? What payment terms will be offered to different distributors of the product and how will adherence be tracked Is a sales force or regional representation required to promote the new product across the US or even internationally? Will discounts be provided for certain markets?  Once actual sales start taking place, a key metric which should be tracked is days receivables outstanding or DSO which measures the time it takes to collect receivables once invoices are issued. The first step in taking control of DSO starts by automating the invoicing and collection process and consider solutions that match incoming payments to remittance data automatically. To optimize DSO further, receivables financing solutions can also be reviewed, thus releasing cash as well as managing the risk on the companies’ balance sheet. On the payable side, the goal is to optimize the days payables outstanding (DPO). When the pay is too slow, discount may be missed, and when pay is too quick, there may be impact to the available cash. One option to extend payment timelines without jeopardizing supplier relationships can be the use of virtual cards to give suppliers immediate payment while the company retains its working capital up to 30 days. Data Protection and Privacy In addition to technology and reliable data, a scalable business will require policies and controls that need to be established and documented early in the lifecycle of the company.  Controls need to be enforced and their effectiveness will depend on the data quality and by the business workflows which the ERP and HR systems enforce consistently across the organization. In addition to good clinical practice (GCP), product safety and manufacturing policies, other policies, and controls to consider are:  Data protection and privacy policy governs how sensitive information such as personal data and confidential business information will be protected Information security policy outlines how information systems, networks, and data will be protected from unauthorized access, theft, and cyberattacks and what to do in case of a breach Compliance policy specifies the company's compliance with relevant laws and regulations including DA, EMA, and other regulatory agencies. Investment Policy governs investment objectives, asset allocation, risk tolerance, diversification and any restrictions Data Quality Policy sets procedures for ensuring the accuracy, completeness, and reliability of data across the organization HR policies covers Recruitment and hiring, Compensation and Benefits, Time Off and Leaves of Absence, and Health and Safety Accounting and Finance policies governs financial reporting, internal controls, revenue recognition, accounts receivable, accounts payable, cash management, budgeting, and tax planning  Well documented policies and controls, combined with the right technology will not only enable the company to grow its operation to scale quickly but also to confidently establish SOX reporting that can hold up to the scrutiny of external auditors, and also prepare the organization for their public filings when the time comes. Significance of Data in Securing Capital According to Deloitte, “…products and solutions that address well-being and care delivery, along with open, secure data and interoperable platforms, are likely to continue receiving the lion’s share of funding”. In addition to providing capital, investors and strategic partners should assume a consultative role, and bring their industry and regulatory experience to innovative startups. Advancing with technology and automation, enforcing policies and controls, establishing a unique value proposition, and most importantly, having a clear business model will all determine the success of a healthcare startup. When partnered with the best investors and consultants for them, innovators can continue to grow, improve quality of care, and deliver value to patients for a better future in healthcare. Investing in the readiness many months or years before the formal authorization is received by the FDA might not be intuitive but lacking the capabilities and functions will lead to performance challenges or avoidable risk exposures that can hurt the future success of the company. Creating the above-mentioned functions on the fly seldomly work and unreliable financial data will most certainly impact obtaining further funding, a public offering or sale of the company. To be successful, a company needs to find common ground with investors, customers, health care providers, patients, and potential acquirers early and often. Stakeholder input is needed early to avoid mistakes that can impede any chance of a success a company may have later down the road. Health care companies are required to amass specific evidence and data to achieve key milestones such as raising capital, regulatory clearance or approval, and obtaining insurance reimbursement or payment. A common mistake is thinking about evidence generation in a linear manner and focusing just on what is needed for the next milestone. This is a common and costly error that can significantly delay time to success. Far too many startups succeed in achieving a regulatory milestone but then run out of funding before generating sufficient evidence to convince customers to buy their products so effective budget planning and allocating is key when it comes to evidence generation. To avoid errors such as this, start conversations early with all relevant stakeholders about what data they will require. Also consider the Food and Drug Administration’s innovative Payor Communication Task Force; this task force involves public and private payers such as Medicare and Medicaid, private health plans, health technology assessment groups, and others in the pre-submission process in conjunction with a parallel review with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to potentially shorten the time between FDA approval and coverage decisions. It’s essential to know who will be paying for your products and how the reimbursement will work. Misunderstanding the complicated and ever-changing economics of payment reimbursements is a costly, and easy one to make. Many health care startups develop a strategy that will let them sell straight to consumers, thinking that it would be a simpler model. They assume this way they are able to skip the time and expense consuming regulatory approval. Angel investors with small pockets tend to favor this strategy. The problem is that this relies on the often-flawed assumption that consumers are willing to pay out of pocket for health-related products and services. Excluding the outliers who are early adopters of the out-of-pocket payments, most consumers naturally want their health plans to pay. As a result, consumer health startups often wind-up pivoting strategies in order to pursue a regulated device strategy, but many run out of the necessary funds before they get there. Making an informed decision on payments strategy early on will help to determine whether your startup will perform better by offering its innovations as regulated or as non-regulated products. Know Your Customers and all indications for your innovations We regularly see startups whose technology has multiple potential indications however they typically choose the initial indication based on the one the company founder knows the most about — a founder who is a liver cancer surgeon, for example, choosing liver cancer over breast cancer. This type of decision making isn’t always the right call, and the evidence generated in an incorrect initial indication can drain resources before you even have the chance to pivot. To arrive at the best indication, complete a value proposition analysis on all indications and choose the one which is the most compelling in terms of market size, competitive landscape, and patient adoption. These qualifiers should help inform the decision on which indication to initially prioritize and pursue. After arriving at this stage, you may think your technology will be adopted because of the potential for improved patient outcomes or lowering overall costs, but if it adds steps or changes a procedure for the ones who are administering your product or service, you are not just disrupting an industry, but the key stakeholders and decision makers. To have the greatest chance at success, the innovative health technology should integrate as seamlessly as possible into existing workflows, not delay, or interrupt them. Therefore, it’s essential to take ownership of knowing the details of every step and aspect of a customer’s workflow including every person who will be affected by it, because one weak link in the new process can potentially prevent your innovation from being adopted. For example, a surgeon may love your technology, but if it impacts a Nurse’s or Technician’s shift workload then an adoption hurdle will loom. Simulating conduct discovery, focus groups, and user testing with every key player in the actual impacted workflow in as many situations as possible can help clarify any pain points or inefficiencies before they become an obstacle in a live environment. Being mindful of the learning points outlined in this white paper should give you a clear starting point of which pain points in your growth you may anticipate and can tackle ahead of time with your business advisory team. Staying proactive in your business strategy at every stage, maintaining a strong brand vision, offering scalable products and services adaptable to serve multiple customer types are paramount for any healthcare startup. What is even more beneficial in addition to what all strong startups have is ensuring that all key stakeholders in your company structure have a comprehensive understanding of all payment and reimbursement dynamic options which are usually moving targets. Wells Fargo is here to help support all aspects of your startup through this exciting, innovative journey and will help you make your mark on the future of positive global healthcare outcomes. Your relationship manager will be pleased to provide more information on Wells Fargo’s financial strategies for the healthcare industry and other correspondent services.

Historically, automating tasks involved removing the people from processes. Today, digital transformation considers the human factor to be essential to systems design. Nowhere is this more vital than in fighting fraud. Key to success requires understanding the relationship between people and technology and developing systems and processes to enable people to supervise automated tasks. When automation alienates  While automation can streamline and simplify, it also often changes the tasks at hand. What was routine for employees can become unfamiliar or even more complex. For example, file encryption can add new steps. Shifting from in-person to online meetings introduces new processes. Technology typically changes how people fit into their environment, and this can be disruptive.  Trust but verify When it comes to fraud detection, every second counts. Technology is a key tool in fast detection. However, sometimes we blindly trust technology. If something doesn’t look right, we may overly rely on what machines tell us is happening while ignoring our common sense.   It’s important to trust but verify your technology. Human intuition is a key skill in early fraud detection and in critical thinking that can help to prevent fraud.   When introducing automation to fight fraud, the human element becomes more, not less important. People must remain a critical part of digital transformation. Even companies that invest in artificial intelligence should not lose sight of the value of human intelligence. Add sensemaking to your fraud detection arsenal Intuitive skills can help us to understand connections between information, circumstances, and our actions so that we can recognize situations, detect problems, and understand how to adapt and respond. This cognitive process is known as sensemaking.  If you are increasing your reliance on automation to detect fraud, human sensemaking becomes an important counterbalance. If you can’t afford to invest in technology, and your people remain your only front-line fraud defense, sensemaking is a particularly valuable skill.  Train employee intuition Making sense takes common sense. However, intuition can be an especially powerful resource when trained. How do you train your people in sensemaking?  Allow employees to trust but verify technology as part of their daily routine. Develop procedures and protocols that support this approach, and train people to follow them. Put checks and balances in place, such as reviewing key reports regularly. Build controls into your technology.  For example, include a human override or kill switch that pauses an automated process from advancing without approval. Cultivate employees not only as sensers but as innovators. It’s important to rely on employees not only to sense when something is wrong but to suggest better procedures. Establish a culture where employees feel comfortable to speak up when they find a better way of doing things, not only for detecting fraud but for preventing it. Training and educational opportunities support this kind of environment.  People are a key factor in fraud detection. Digital transformation aimed at fighting fraud should be designed with human oversight in mind. As part of this, it’s important to cultivate the ability for employees to sense when something is not right and to act accordingly.

With sales and other functions curtailed, payments are crucial to business viability, now may be the time to enhance your accounts receivable and payable by implementing the following strategies. Refine accounts receivable Move to electronic receivables. Checks require people to be physically present to handle them. If you’ve been meaning to move to electronic payments for efficiency reasons, this is a good reason to do it now. Talk to customers about paying you by ACH, RTP, or online, and redesign invoices to show your preferred payment methods. Talk to your bank about setting up electronic receivables services. Post unapplied payments. You want customers to buy from you again, and soon. Open their receivable accounts by researching and posting unapplied payments. Update your receivables accounts. Remove inactive accounts and duplicates. A clean list may help make processing payments faster and easier and help avoid exceptions. Review past-due accounts. Connecting with your customers is important. If they can’t pay the full amount, perhaps offer discounts or set up payment plans. You may want to add or assign resources to help bring in needed cash. Hone accounts payable Make more payments electronically. If you’re having trouble printing checks, your customers are having trouble receiving them. Offer electronic payment options such as ACH, RTP, and commercial card. Reach out to suppliers. If you have invoices that are difficult to process, tell your suppliers how they may help make your invoice processing easier. It may be as simple as including the P.O. number or invoice number on their bills. Clean up master vendor files. Vendor contact names, phone numbers, addresses, and terms keep changing. To help avoid duplicate payments and business email compromise (BEC) fraud, validate the information on file, remove duplicates, and archive inactive vendors. Handle uncashed checks. No one wants checks to go into escheatment. If you have checks uncashed past their stale dates, try to contact payees to learn why they haven’t been cashed. Moving away from check payments to electronic payments can lessen the likelihood of creating unclaimed property. Prepare for exigencies to come After Superstorm Sandy, the Great Recession, COVID-19, and more, who knows what’s coming next. Increase your preparedness with these BCP measures. Write or update standard operating procedures (SOPS). When you have turnover or absenteeism, structured process management will enable business as usual. Cross-train employees. Build bench strength so jobs will get done when the usual team members are unavailable. Conduct fraud training. Businesses are more vulnerable to fraud in times of turmoil. Increase fraud awareness – especially awareness of business email compromise fraud – through video conferencing or meetings. As you implement these best practices, you may gain insights into where and how you might improve your processes. Insights you can put into action when normalcy returns.

 As businesses navigate the current economic landscape, their treasurers are facing an increasingly complex and volatile environment. Two key areas of concern are the implications of high interest rates and supply chain risks. These factors can impact a company's liquidity position and working capital, making effective management of these areas of critical importance. High Interest Rates Interest rates are a crucial component of the financial system, influencing borrowing costs, savings rates, and investment returns. When interest rates rise, there are implications for treasurers, with two primary ways that high-interest rates can impact a business’s finances.  Firstly, the cost of refinancing debt increases. As interest rates rise, the cost of borrowing for companies also goes up. With 78.8% of investment-grade U.S. corporate debt maturing this year, the impact of higher borrowing costs for companies to refinance their debt can impact their cash flows and profitability. Treasurers need to assess the implications of rising interest rates on their organization’s debt servicing costs and develop strategies to mitigate the impact. At times like this, access to excess cash reserves and optimizing receivables management become paramount. Secondly, treasurers need to re-evaluate their hedging strategies. These could be both on and off-balance sheet. The more obvious hedges companies can take advantage of are where companies enter derivative hedging contracts to manage interest rate risk. When interest rates increase, the value of these contracts may change triggering calls on cash. There also remain the need for hedging embedded risks in a company’s supply chain. Supply Chain Risks The pandemic has disrupted global supply chains, increasing the focus on diversifying the supplier base and near-shoring production centers. However, these strategies also come with their own set of potential risks, such as increased freight costs, fewer discounts due to lower individual purchase orders and foreign exchange risk. Adding to this could be the differing approaches by central banks in their response to inflation and subsequent rate hikes which have increased volatility in the foreign exchange markets. All of this could trigger re-pricing clauses in supply contracts, increasing the demand for cash to fund payables. Managing Liquidity Positions and Working Capital Given the uncertainties in the current economic environment, treasurers should adopt a proactive approach to managing their liquidity positions and working capital. Some strategies that treasurers could use to manage their liquidity positions and working capital effectively include: 1. Improve visibility on cash flows and off-balance sheet liabilities Treasurers should have a clear understanding of their cash flow requirements and develop robust cash flow forecasting models to manage their liquidity positions effectively. Treasurers should work closely with the business development and procurement teams to advise them on the re-pricing risks embedded in supply contracts and to thereafter include these contingent liabilities into their cash flow projections. These should be considered when procurement might not be able to lock in pricing for future deliveries creating uncertainty for cash outflows and their timing. 2. Optimize working capital across the supply chain Treasurers should work closely with their procurement and supply chain teams to optimize their working capital, as they could potentially reduce the amount of cash tied up in inventory and accounts receivable and have plans ready to extend payables if required. 3. Work closely with suppliers Given the supply chain risks, treasurers may work closely with suppliers through their procurement teams to ensure they are meeting their contractual obligations and to develop contingency plans in case of disruptions and shipping delays even as their companies execute plans to diversify their supplier base. 4. Consider alternative financing options Treasurers could consider alternative financing options, such as factoring or supply chain finance, to improve their liquidity positions. Smaller companies could benefit from supplier financing if the supplier has lower financing costs. For smaller ticket items, corporate purchase card programs could be considered. 5. Work closely with their bank Treasurers should review their bank’s capital, short term liquidity metrics, and discuss their lending capacity. Treasurers should ensure that their bank is aware of any refinancing or new financing plans. Conclusion The current economic environment is characterized by high interest rates and supply chain risks, making it critical for treasurers to manage their liquidity positions and working capital effectively. By focusing on cash flow forecasting, optimizing working capital, refocusing on supply chain risks, and considering alternative financing options, treasurers can mitigate the impact of these risks on their working capital in an effort to ensure that their organizations remain financially stable.

With rates rising and the cost of funds increasing, there’s a new sense of urgency for companies to improve efficiency, reduce expenses, and maximize liquidity. Centralizing some or all treasury management functions, such as cash management, helps achieve this goal.  Transforming treasury operations is not a new concept. However, it’s become more critical as treasury management’s role in the organization grows more strategic.  A centralized treasury structure provides greater visibility, improves control, and automates and streamlines processes. It arms senior leaders with the information and systems needed to make insightful decisions and act quickly. Centralizing cash management yields many benefits Cash management is one of the best places to centralize because the benefits will be immediate and tangible. It enables you to access your daily cash position quickly and easily, then make strategic decisions about excess funds and idle cash with speed and agility.  Numerous other benefits are possible with a centralized structure. Treasury can take advantage of:  Standard processes, controls, and metrics across the entire organization that streamline daily work, reduce risk, and improve treasury’s line of sight.  A single entity managing risk, which simplifies counterparty relationships and lets global organizations take greater advantage of natural hedging for foreign exchange (FX). Stronger working capital and liquidity management which can minimize external borrowing requirements and increase return on equity (ROE). Increased operational efficiencies, made possible with fewer bank accounts to manage, optimal FTE staffing, and for more sophisticated companies, shared service centers for payables, receivables, and other transactions.  Move toward centralization with these fundamental first steps Moving away from a decentralized structure can seem overwhelming. But, like many journeys, the hardest part is often figuring out where to begin.  First, establish your company’s long-term vision for centralization. Use your bank as a resource at this stage—they can help you compare options, share best practices, and provide insight into how similar companies handle their cash management and liquidity. Next, identify discrete short-term projects that are manageable in scope and can deliver measurable results. Consider these key elements: Get buy-in from stakeholders. No strategic project works well without top-down support. Enlist C-suite and line of business leaders for sponsorship and input, then keep them up-to-date on progress and early wins. Rationalize your bank accounts. Start with an inventory of banks and accounts across the organization. Identify the type and purpose of each, along with ownership and signatory capabilities. Look at currencies as well. This exercise will help you standardize across entities, ensure the right controls are in place, and as needed, consolidate for more efficient banking relationships and liquidity management.  Evaluate local versus central control. Centralizing cash management and other treasury management functions doesn’t have to be “all or nothing.” Hybrid options can give ownership to local entities while simultaneously automating processes, strengthening oversight, and improving cash management. Work with your bank to understand your options, then match strategies to your desired level of control.  Review technology options. In the past, centralizing meant arduous IT integrations and lengthy timeframes. Today, even in-house banks require very little IT effort, thanks to cloud-based solutions, real-time connectivity with APIs, and automated ledger entries. Achieving your goals may be faster and more cost-effective than you think, with banks, fintechs, and ERP providers all delivering “plug and play” solutions.  Take advantage of early wins Just as the journey image implies, change and centralization won’t happen overnight. But, every decision that standardizes a process, automates a workflow, or centralizes access to cash will help treasury operate more effectively. Set appropriate expectations with stakeholders, then work with your bank to find early wins you can measure, celebrate, and build from.


=== Contents of com-insights-treasury-insights-rtp-fednow-comprehensive-instant-payment-strategy-.txt ===

First, there were electronic transactions with next business day settlement. Then faster payments arrived, revolutionizing how companies and consumers move money. Now, two instant payment methods push speed and availability even faster: RTP® from The Clearing House® and the upcoming FedNowSM service.  Both platforms can help companies reach domestic DDA accountholders 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year, with irrevocable transactions. RTPs allow payments up to $1 million; FedNow will launch with a $500,000 per-transaction limit.  With so many choices in the market, many treasury professionals are asking, should we deploy RTP now? Or wait until 2023 and adopt FedNow? Which method is best for our disbursement needs? Instead of taking a “wait and see” approach, there’s good reason for businesses to consult with their banks now to make sure you’re maximizing the opportunity presented by instant payment methods. Savvy financial institutions are working side-by-side with payment providers and customers to make using these new methods as seamless as possible.  Gain a competitive advantage with instant payments Instant payment rails like RTP and FedNow empower businesses to send and receive payments within seconds, giving payees almost immediate access to the funds.  This speed and control provides a number of potential benefits: Stronger liquidity management. Instant payments can reduce uncertainty from payment delays and boost working capital, helping businesses strengthen liquidity management and reduce the need for excess cash on hand to cover emergencies or float. Greater customer and supplier satisfaction. No matter who your business pays, reducing the time and effort it takes to receive funds makes a difference. Paying time-sensitive contracts or insurance claims with instant transaction capabilities, for example, can improve your brand experience and even be a competitive differentiator.  Reduced friction across the payment process. Instant payments not only settle faster, they also make invoicing, deposits, posting, and other accounting activities easier. Unlike checks or other payment types, there’s less need for data entry or research to apply payments. “Request for payment” functionality can even eliminate invoicing. Use instant payments when speed, accuracy, and finality matter How will you know which instant payment methods are right for your organization? Start by considering your use cases. Instant payments like FedNow and RTP work best when speed, accuracy, and finality are critical to the transaction.  Early adopters use instant payments for scenarios like these:  Mortgage and lending payoffs at closing Insurance claims settlements to policyholders Emergency payroll and gig employee payouts for the company workforce Merger and acquisition transactions Time-sensitive payments to key suppliers  Next, work with your bank to understand the requirements for issuing instant payments via The Clearing House and the Federal Reserve. Connectivity will be important, as these transactions may require an alternative to daily batch processing.  Payee preference is another factor. Providing your suppliers and customers with options for instant payment can lead to greater satisfaction with your organization. Look for bank tools that help you with payment “decisioning” so you can serve your payees well, without adding extra workload for your team. An instant payments engine lets you send transaction details, while your bank helps manage the process of routing each disbursement through the best instant payments network for your business need.  Lastly, consider the impacts of non-refutable transactions. How will you update your internal treasury management policies and controls, and set appropriate permissions and limits in your systems, so you’re assured your payments reach the correct recipients? Leveraging dual controls, account validation, and other services will help everyone in your company transact with confidence.  Modernize your payments experience In the blink of an eye, it’s now possible to move money safely, efficiently, and conveniently. RTPs and FedNow help your business enjoy these benefits and stay current with the latest instant payment options.

[MUSIC UP]  Wells Fargo Global Treasury Management  Treasury Take  A collection of Global Treasury management videos featuring client business leaders sharing knowledge, experience, insights and strategies.  What it truly means to digitize your organization  The path to digitization  Adam Rigby  Senior lead Digital Product Manager  Wells Fargo Global Treasury Management  Michelle Austin  Chief Financial Officer  Smith Bagley, Inc.  Adam Rigby: Digitizing your organization can take a number of different forms. I am Adam Rigby with Wells Fargo and today I have with me Michelle Austin from Smith Bagley, Inc, the Chief Financial Officer, to talk about what her experience has been like digitizing her organization. Can you talk a little bit about where you are in your company's journey today?  Michelle Austin: Yes, at Smith Bagley, back in 2020, during the pandemic we realized that we really needed a solution to pay our vendors remotely. And so, in 2021 looked and met with a number of different solutions and in 2022 actually implemented a consolidated file process. What that does for us is allows us, our staff, to be 100% remote. We basically take an open payables file and transform that through some help from our MIS department. And that then is uploaded in into the file portal and from there all the payments are done by a third-party vendor. So, it’s been a great solution for us. It’s allowed us, like I said, some efficiencies, in addition to doing something that doesn’t matter if we have staff in the office or not.  Back to Adam: Can you talk a little bit about what it means for your AP team in terms of efficiency because you’ve implemented that change?  Back to Michelle: It’s been great, so our team can work, like I said, 100% remote. I don’t have to worry about having people in the office to get the check stock, sign the checks, stuff the checks, put them in the mail. Saved us some direct costs obviously for all the same reasons, and it’s allowed us really to repurpose that labor. So, we’ve got staff today that used to spend their time doing the very manual tasks that I just described and now they can focus on more important things.  Back to Adam: Thank you Michelle, I appreciate you joining us here today.  Back to Michelle: You’re very welcome.

Michelle is going to talk to us a little bit about what it’s been like at her organization to digitize her business. Michelle, as you’ve been evaluating traditional processes vs digitization options. What have you been weighing in as the pros and cons for the alternatives?  Michelle Austin: Well, what I would like to see for our organization is ultimately, we would have a system for the accounts payable side where we have our invoices come in electronically. We have them processed and sent out remotely to the approvers, and then they come back into our AP system, and that would all be done through AI.  On the receivables side, a similar process where we can do reconciliations electronically and then consolidation of our payment streams.  We receive a number of payments from our customers through various forms and so looking for a way to consolidate all of that through AI on the backend as well, that would be great.  Obviously, the technology has to be balanced with the cost.

=== Contents of com-insights-treasury-insights-treasury-evolving-real-time--.txt ===

By John Hunter, Head of Global Treasury Management Payments and Transaction Services Wells Fargo   The era of “real time” has arrived. Speed has changed our lives dramatically compared to just a few years ago, impacting everything from sending and receiving funds in an instant, to streaming live content, to checking the status of your order with a simple click. “Now” is the new normal; waiting is no longer an option.   Yet in many finance departments it’s still business as usual. Payments, reporting, and liquidity management all rely on the same day-old (or older) data, the same batch processing and manual operations that were “leading edge” more than a decade ago.  Setting a new standard for cash management  If your treasury seems trapped in the past, it’s definitely time to move forward. Instant access to data can revolutionize your company’s financial operations, as well as your customer, supplier, and employee experiences. Considering your options now, as well as involving your bank in planning will ensure you keep pace with the latest developments as they become available.  Innovations in technology make real-time enhancements possible, leveling the playing field for smaller organizations. In the past, only large and sophisticated companies could invest in custom ERP upgrades and system-to-system connectivity. Now, real-time tools like APIs and webhooks, greater adoption of industry standards, and the leadership of key banks are all helping to simplify and democratize real-time access.  New solutions will be scalable for small and medium-sized businesses as well as global enterprises. The result is a new standard for real-time cash management.  7 ways to accelerate progress  Consider opportunities like these for treasury management to put real-time connectivity into practical application.   Imagine making liquidity decisions and mobilizing your cash based on up-to-the-minute balances pulled from accounts at multiple banks. Imagine simplifying your transactions, so each payment uses the method that’s fastest, safest, and most cost-effective.  Imagine making customer service a great experience with automatic notifications and real-time transaction status, all from within your product or mobile app.   There’s even more potential on the horizon as banks and fintechs continue innovating. We’re excited about these seven scenarios: 1. Route your payments efficiently The options for sending and receiving transactions continue to grow, adding complexity and at times, cost. When you have a handful of critical payments, it’s feasible to research the most efficient method (such as wires, Same Day ACH, RTP, or the new FedNow network). But scaling those decisions for larger payment volumes requires substantial information, processing power, and automation.  Enter intelligent routing. With a solution like this, you and your bank will create business rules specific to your priorities, whether you need speed of settlement, lowest processing cost, international reach, or other capabilities. Then, your bank’s payment platform will deploy the best transaction method. The delivery industry already employs this type of tool with great success, letting smart technology recommend the best carrier and delivery timeframe for shipments – so why not do the same with your payments.  2. Detect fraud attempts instantly What if instant access to data could better protect your funds? Your bank, your fraud protection services, and the payment networks you use already collect and monitor thousands of datapoints in real-time. Imagine accessing this sophisticated intelligence to spot potential fraud and misuse before a payment occurs. Real-time connectivity can power this type of solution in the near future. For example, if you’ve never before made a payment in Asia, or if your standard transaction is $5,000 not $50,000, a real-time fraud protection service could detect anomalies and notify your team before you issue the payment. With more irrevocable transactions and real-time settlement, it will be an important safeguard to put on your treasury “must have” list.  3. Reduce your exceptions Who hasn’t been frustrated by the legwork and delays of payment exceptions? Everything from transposed numbers to closed accounts to missing data can strand a payment midstream. Instant connectivity has the potential to alleviate this situation.  In this scenario, instead of sending a batch file for next-day transmission (or printing and mailing checks), imagine technology that can evaluate immediately if payments are complete and accounts are valid—even repairing minor discrepancies automatically. Real-time communications between payment originators, your bank, and other payment endpoints bring this solution to life. 4. Pay non-traditional endpoints Digital wallets bring speed and convenience to consumers, who are adopting them in record numbers. Yet as more companies add branded wallets to their product or service, they’re realizing the right back-office platforms are critical to success.  Rather than adding another vendor to manage, imagine working directly through your bank to establish the real-time connectivity that powers a custom digital wallet experience. One trusted resource could help you design an intuitive workflow, accept new payment methods, and at the same time, enable the necessary back-office functions such as real-time validation, notifications, and reconciliation. 5. Consolidate your reporting When your operations span multiple divisions, countries, currencies, and banks, activities like forecasting and daily cash positioning become arduous. What if, instead of logging into various bank portals, downloading information, and updating complicated spreadsheets, you could find the data you need in a single location?  Consolidated multi-bank real-time reporting is becoming a reality now available, thanks to API connectivity between systems, a push for open banking standards, and comprehensive dashboards. This innovation arms treasury management with sophisticated and up-to-the-minute intelligence across your cash footprint. Staff spend their valuable time evaluating options rather than searching for details.  6. Use your money wisely In rising rate environments, how you manage your liquidity takes on extra significance. But, identifying excess working capital and making smart investment decisions means fast access to data. It’s especially critical for organizations that do business internationally, with cash spread out in accounts worldwide.  APIs and real-time tools can vastly improve your visibility and accelerate your cash flow velocity. Working capital solutions like notional pooling, for example, let you automate and mobilize your excess cash more easily than ever; you can centralize cash management without actually comingling funds or making intercompany loans. Instant access to balances and pending transactions can create other advantages. With real-time solutions, you can make confident decisions in where to spend, where to invest, and how to best use your funds to achieve your business goals.  7. Empower customer service Who hasn’t wondered about the status of an order or when an important payment will arrive? It’s not just a question that finance struggles to answer—employees want to track expense reimbursements; customers and suppliers need accurate data to manage their own balance sheets and update their stakeholders. Real-time access to banking data will be able to supercharge your customer service. Instead of lengthy phone calls or strings of emails, imagine completing payment-related activities directly from your customer-facing mobile app, website, or product. With embedded commerce, you can design the workflow; your bank can supply the data to support your full order-to-cash lifecycle. Make instant data access a priority for treasury Instant access to financial data can accelerate operations, improve decision-making, and increase productivity. It brings benefits that extend far beyond treasury management, to senior leadership, valued customers, and trading partners. There’s no better time than now to talk with your bank about adding real-time capabilities.

Account takeover fraud occurs when a fraudster obtains confidential information – including user IDs, passwords, PINs, and token codes – and uses it to access online banking accounts, transfer funds, or commit other fraudulent acts. Fraudsters gain access by tricking you to divulge your online banking credentials or installing malicious software (malware) on your devices.

If you’re a B2C business, creating a modern billing and payment experience can reach valuable customers and set your company apart. Younger buyers, in particular, consider flexible payment options and convenient digital tools as “table stakes” when choosing their preferred providers.  One-quarter of Millennials, for example, report prioritizing for payment those bills “with the least payment friction.” Another study notes that when given the option, 60 percent of consumers have used a digital wallet (such as  Apple Pay or Google Pay) to pay their bills, attracted by the ability to “pay instantly.” Cash and checks are also in flux as more consumers opt for cards or digital methods. Six in 10 Americans now expect to see a cashless society in their lifetimes. How to stay current with B2C expectations Given all the options, moving your consumer receivables forward can seem overwhelming. Where should you start? Which payment methods should you accept? How can you offer consumers more choices, while at the same time, keep your processing costs and accounts receivable (AR) workload under control? A step-by-step approach will make the process manageable.  Step 1: Make digital-first a priority Before making any changes, look at your customer base and get a better understanding of how and when they want to pay you. Consider also your business model.   Are you a “receipt-only” business where purchase and payment occur simultaneously, such as a coffee shop, an auto repair facility, an online bookstore, or an e-ticketing site?  Or, are you a “receivables” business like a dentist’s office, insurance company, or utility that needs to issue regular invoices, creating a longer and more complicated consumer collection cycle?   Once you know more about your target audience and their payment preferences, you can choose the right electronic payment options. Security and ease of use will be two important criteria so you can make digital payment convenient for consumers, without adding fraud or other risks to your business practices.  Step 2: Streamline your AR workload Adding new billing and payment options is not without its challenges, especially when B2C companies work with numerous payment providers. It can be difficult to create a streamlined and cost-effective solution across many vendors and systems.  As your business invests in electronic billing and payments, involve your bank in an open dialogue about your receivables goals and challenges. Many times, simple changes can make a big impact for AR teams and your bottom line.  For example, if you’re a receivables business that issues customer bills, make sure you’re using digital invoices with a “pay now” button. Your bank can host the electronic payment options of your choice on a secure website that’s branded to your business. A “pay now” feature can significantly increase payment speed and reduce the hassle of accepting checks.  If your customers pay through online bill pay sites, you can optimize your cash flow and increase straight-through processing with a bank-hosted electronic lockbox, or “eBox.” This service aggregates and standardizes all the digital payments you receive through online bill pay sites. Instead of checks and missing information from these third-parties, you receive electronic deposits and consolidated posting files with the account and invoice numbers you need. Step 3: Keep modernizing The consumer payment landscape continues to evolve, as do customer expectations. Fortunately, payment billing and innovations are keeping pace. Savvy B2C businesses are keeping tabs on solutions such as buy now, pay later (BNPL) short-term financing at point-of-sale, faster payment options like the FedNow service, and new ways to integrate mobile devices into the B2C purchase experience. Consumers appear ready to take invoicing and payments by SMS text messaging into the mainstream. They recognize that a text or email reminding them a bill is due makes it easier to pay on time. They also value “pay now” links embedded in reminder messages which make it easier to complete an online payment.   These and other payment innovations give B2C companies a range of ways to satisfy consumers, optimize your cash conversion cycle, and differentiate your business. Your bank can help you navigate the options and choose the solutions that best meet your specific needs.

Helping you streamline online bill payment processing  Initiating bill payments through a single, trusted banking site may be convenient, simple, and paperless for your customers, but the convenience enjoyed by consumers as they schedule their payments online does not always proceed through the Bill Service Provider (BSP) to the Biller. This is due to the fact that many payments, initially submitted online, still end up being mailed out as paper checks by the BSP. These check-only payments create exceptions and often have incomplete or inaccurate remittance details, which can result in further processing delays. The Wells Fargo E-Box® service is a comprehensive solution, enabling you to manage your online remittance process in a consolidated electronic data stream. With flexible multi-step validation and exception handling options, the E-Box service helps you maximize your straight-through electronic processing rate and minimize your exceptions.  Extensive connectivity to major originating endpoints  Wells Fargo connects to all major originating endpoints, including our extensive network of third-party concentrators, to help you maximize your electronic payments. Leverage the experience of our dedicated E-Box staff in working with billers from multiple industries, including energy and power, financial services, media and telecommunications, the public sector, and originators to implement an efficient electronic receivables solution.  The Wells Fargo advantage   Consolidated file and settlement. You receive a single remittance file and settlement for all online bill payments.  Select from one or more of our convenient processing windows.  Extensive provider network. Maximize electronic payment volume and reduce paper check payment processed, speeding up delivery time when payments are processed electronically, creating a better customer experience.  Robust account validation. With multi-step validation including account masking format, cross reference database processing and the use of inbound validation files, incorrect billing account data provided by consumers can be corrected automatically.  Efficient exception management. Streamline your staff’s workflow around exception items to enhance process efficiency, improve productivity, and minimize costs. Through E-Box Decisioning on our Commercial Electronic Office® (CEO®) portal, you can view, research, and return completed transaction, make decisions on pending transactions, and gain access to information for purposes of reporting and trend analysis.

Whether you are looking to reduce Days Sales Outstanding (DSO), streamline payments acceptance, enhance data security, or increase customer satisfaction, our Merchant Services consultants specializing in B2B solutions can provide guidance and solutions. Help offset the cost of card processing with surcharging A surcharge is a percent fee that may be applied only to credit card transactions. Wells Fargo supports surcharging only for commercial and corporate banking segment merchants whose business-to-business (B2B) transactions represent at least 50% of their total credit card transaction volume.  Surcharging example: A wholesaler charges a 2% surcharge for qualified B2B credit card payments where other forms of payment do not have this fee. Key information about surcharging:  May not exceed the lower of either (a) the maximum rate permitted by each payment network or (b) the actual processing cost. May not be applied to debit cards or prepaid cards. Supported by Visa, Mastercard®, American Express® OptBlue, and Discover®. The lowest surcharge rate must apply to all payment networks. Must be the only cardholder fee charged by the merchant (it can’t be charged in addition to a service fee). State laws may vary, so it’s important to consult your legal counsel to determine your obligations and if fees are regulated or prohibited before implementing any cardholder fee. 


Professional services
Adaptable and secure Merchant Services solutions for professional services Your business model is unique and requires adaptable and secure payment acceptance processing. Strategies such as large ticket interchange programs and passing Level 2 and 3 data can reduce the cost of accepting card payments. Products like online bill presentment and payment can help reduce days sales outstanding (DSO).

Let’s talk about tailoring a merchant services solution that can meet your needs.

Government
Provide more efficient payment options for constituents You may be looking for more efficient payment acceptance solutions to counter budget shortfalls, new legislation, increased risk, and shifting workforce demographics.

Let our Merchant Services consultants help you identify solutions to turn those challenges into opportunities. Service fees can help reduce or eliminate the cost of accepting card payments A service fee is a variable or a flat fee that may be applied to debit card and credit card transactions through any payment channel.  Service fee example: A city government agency charges a 2% service fee to pay for building permits with a debit card or credit card instead of a check or another form of payment.

Healthcare
Accelerate your revenue cycle Taking care of patients while managing your revenue cycle is not for the faint of heart.

In fact, 42% of consumers are either likely to switch or have already switched health care providers for a better payments experience.  The right payments acceptance technology can securely store patient payment credentials on file for their convenience while also helping to settle balances quickly after insurance adjudication. Talk to a Merchant Services consultant today about how we can help your practice thrive.

Satisfy your diners’ needs while optimizing your payments acceptance process with technology designed to speed table turns. Talk with a Merchant Services consultant who can serve up solutions to meet your payment processing needs. 


Technology, media, and telecom
Securely and effectively manage subscriber payments The subscription and recurring billing services market is projected to reach $1.5 trillion by 2025.

Our Merchant Services consultants dedicated to higher education can help you map all your collection channels with corresponding payment options. We’ll then work closely with your treasury team and department stakeholders to consolidate payments technologies and streamline the cash application process.  Service fees can help reduce or eliminate the cost of accepting card payments A service fee is a variable or a flat fee that may be applied to debit card and credit card transactions through any payment channel.  Service fee example: A city government agency charges a 2% service fee to pay for building permits with a debit card or credit card instead of a check or another form of payment. Key information about service fees:   Limited to specific government and education Merchant Category Codes (MCCs). Supported by Visa, Mastercard, American Express, and Discover.  Must be the only cardholder fee charged by the merchant (it can’t be charged in addition to a surcharge).

Efficiently offer electronic B2B payment options Employing the right tools to support B2B transactions can optimize cost and efficiency. Whether you are looking to reduce Days Sales Outstanding (DSO), streamline payments acceptance, enhance data security, or increase customer satisfaction, our Merchant Services consultants specializing in B2B solutions can provide guidance and solutions. Help offset the cost of card processing with surcharging A surcharge is a percent fee that may be applied only to credit card transactions. Wells Fargo supports surcharging only for commercial and corporate banking segment merchants whose business-to-business (B2B) transactions represent at least 50% of their total credit card transaction volume.  Surcharging example: A wholesaler charges a 2% surcharge for qualified B2B credit card payments where other forms of payment do not have this fee. Key information about surcharging:  May not exceed the lower of either (a) the maximum rate permitted by each payment network or (b) the actual processing cost. May not be applied to debit cards or prepaid cards. Supported by Visa, Mastercard®, American Express® OptBlue, and Discover®. The lowest surcharge rate must apply to all payment networks. Must be the only cardholder fee charged by the merchant (it can’t be charged in addition to a service fee). State laws may vary, so it’s important to consult your legal counsel to determine your obligations and if fees are regulated or prohibited before implementing any cardholder fee.

Wells Fargo & Company is an American multinational financial services company with a significant global presence.[6][3] The company operates in 35 countries and serves over 70 million customers worldwide.[3] It is a systemically important financial institution according to the Financial Stability Board, and is considered one of the "Big Four Banks" in the United States, alongside JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, and Citigroup.[7]

The firm's primary subsidiary is Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., a national bank that designates its Sioux Falls, South Dakota, site as its main office (and therefore is treated by most U.S. federal courts as a citizen of South Dakota).[8] It is the fourth-largest bank in the United States by total assets and is also one of the largest as ranked by bank deposits and market capitalization. It has 8,050 branches and 13,000 automated teller machines[3] and 2,000 stand-alone mortgage branches. It is the second largest retail mortgage originator in the United States, originating one out of every four home loans[9] and services $1.8 trillion in home mortgages, one of the largest servicing portfolios in the US.[3] It is one of the most valuable bank brands.[10][11] Wells Fargo is ranked 47th on the Fortune 500 list of the largest companies in the U.S.[12]

In addition to banking, the company provides equipment financing via subsidiaries including Wells Fargo Rail and provides investment management and stockbrokerage services. A key part of Wells Fargo's business strategy is cross-selling, the practice of encouraging existing customers to buy additional banking services.[13][14][15][16] This led to the Wells Fargo cross-selling scandal.

Wells Fargo has international offices in Hong Kong, London, Dubai, Singapore, Tokyo, and Toronto.[17] Back-offices are in India and the Philippines with more than 20,000 staff.[18]

Wells Fargo operates under Charter No. 1, the first national bank charter issued in the United States. This charter was issued to First National Bank of Philadelphia on June 20, 1863, by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.[19] Wells Fargo, in its present form, is a result of a merger between the original Wells Fargo & Company and Minneapolis-based Norwest Corporation in 1998. While Norwest was the nominal survivor, the merged company took the better-known Wells Fargo name and moved to Wells Fargo's hub in San Francisco. At the same time, its banking subsidiary merged with Wells Fargo's Sioux Falls-based banking subsidiary. Wells Fargo became a coast-to-coast bank with the 2008 acquisition of Charlotte-based Wachovia.

In 2022, Wells Fargo announced a goal of reducing absolute emissions by companies it lends to in the oil and gas sector by 26% by 2030 from 2019 levels. Some critics say these goals conflict with the bank being the largest lender to fossil fuel companies in the U.S. and one of the largest globally.[90] The company has committed to net zero financed emissions by 2050; however, major environmental groups are skeptical if this goal will be achieved. The company has stated that it will not finance any hydrocarbon exploration projects in the Arctic. The company has also provided financing to renewable energy projects.

In the United States, the "big four" banks hold about 45% of all U.S. customer deposits (as of 2018), and each have assets of more than 1.7 trillion U.S. Dollars.[76] The banks are, in order of size:
JPMorgan Chase (headquartered in New York City, bank chartered in Columbus, Ohio)
Bank of America (headquartered and bank chartered in Charlotte, North Carolina)
Citigroup (headquartered in New York City, bank chartered in Sioux Falls, South Dakota)
Wells Fargo (headquartered in San Francisco, bank chartered in Sioux Falls, South Dakota)
